xxiv INTRODUCTION.

as founded on bad translations of Aristotle (Brewer‚ compend.
studii, cap. il), would be conclusive as to his personal contact
with this great man, even though it were not confirmed by
reference to Grosseteste’s scientific writings, in which Bacon's
debt to him is unmistakable. His treatise Dc Physicis Limis,
Α regulis, et Frgrrris contains passages as to the spherical radia·
tion of force, and as to the change in its direction by reflection
and refraction, which bear a close resemblance to the lan-
guage used many years afterwards by Racon.

lt would appear that, at the beginning of the thirteenth
century, there was a stronger impulse towards scientific study
in Oxford than in Paris In the eleventh chapter of the Opus
Tertium, when speaking of the science of Optics‚ Bacon
observes, ‘On this science no lectures have as yet been given
in Paris, nor anywhere among the Latins, except twice at
Oxford.’ Itis not stated that the lecturer was Grosseteste;
but we may well believe it. It may be supposed that the
influence of Adelard of Rath, the first translator of Euclid, had
left its traces. Twenty years before the close of the twelfth
century we hear of two Englishmen‚ Alexander Neckham and.
Alfred Sershall‚ lecturing in Paris on the Physics of Aristotle,
then recently introduced from the school of translators from
Arabic directed by Archbishop Raymond of Toledo.

But the University of Paris, placed nearer the centre of the
spiritual forces that swayed mediaeval society, had grown up
under the dialectical influences of theological controversy3
and when Bacon went there, perhaps about ¹²40, he found
what is called, vaguely and inaccurately enough, the scholastic
philosophy in the fullness of its growth, with the enlarged
scope given to it by the recent permission to study the Physicsj
Metaphysics, and Psychology of Aristotle. Its two most
prominent representatives were at this time Alexander of
Hales and William of Auvergne. Of the methods and the
controversies then current Bacon made himself a master, and
received the title of doctor. To be able to speak the language
of the schools with authority was the first condition of obtain-
ing a hearing. But he was not slow to perceive that the men
who taught this philosophy were, for the most part, wholly
