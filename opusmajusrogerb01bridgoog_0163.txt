ι their proper place. lt is called by Aristotle Moral Science; by
others Civil Science, as laying down the obligations ot' citizens and
states; the city standing in old times in the place 01 the modern
state or empire. It falls under two divisione: first, the establish-
ment of laws 01 conduct; secondly, exhortatione towards their
sulfilment ........... 223-225
The first division consists 01 three parts: (1)(101)1 10 God; (a) duty
to our neighbour; (3) duty to ourselves. These three divisions are
indicated both in the Old and in the New Testament. We may
begin by laying down certain principles either held by this science in
common with Metaphysics, or reached through metaphysica] methods
which here would be out of place These are, (1) that God exists;
(a) that He is naturally known to man; (3) that He is oi infinite
power and wisd0m; (4l that He is One3 (5) that He is also Trine;
(6) that He is the author of Nature3 (7) 01 angelic substances3
(8) 01 human souls; (9) these are immortal; (ιο) the highest good
is in the future life; (11) man’s capacity ior this good; (12) the
moral govemmeut 01 the world3 (13) future rewards and punish-
ments; (14) the worship 01 God; (15) nran's duty to his neighbour
and to himselt'3 (16) the need of revelation; (17) of mediation 0
between Godand man ........ 225-228
There are other principles of which Metaphysics can take no
cognitance—relating to the nature 01 God and the angela and to future
lise. 01 these the first is the Triune nature 01 God. Something 01 this
hasbeen revealed to the ancient philosophers‚ having been received by
them from the patriarche, as explained in the second part ot' this
work. Plato and Porphyrius are instances 01 this ; examples may be
found also in Aristutle and Avicenna ..... 228-232
The mutual relations of the three Perseus of the Trinity constitute
the first foundations of Moral Science. Next to this is the lucarna-
tion. Here too many traces ot' knowledge os the truth are discover-
ahle in the ancient philosophers‚ both Greek and Arabian. There are
alsot'acts in natural history pointing in the same direction . eoa-234
The coming 01 Antichrist is also an article os saith, 01 which some
knowledge is to be observed in the writings 01 Greek and Arabian
philosophers‚ and which some have thought is to be lullilled in the
actual Tartar invasions‚ though this is uncertain. lt will be followed
by the final punishment 01 the Evil oire ..... att-235
The creation 01 the world and 01 the human race is also a principle
laid down in the writings 01 Aristode, Albumazar‚ and others. We
find also the doctrine of the existence 01 angela, good aud bad. The
former direct the motione 01 the heavenly bodies; and one 01 these
is specially attached to the destiny ol each human being as his
guide through iiie. Bad angele may tempt him to evil . . 285-238
