We shall find that the four elemental substances can carry their

action to completion, and especially the clement offire . . 449-451
But many compound substantes are higher in rank than the

elemental. Why cannot they do the same? There resides in them

an aptitude lor doing this, but they are practically debarred from

doing it. Were it otherwise, the higher substances would transmute

the lower into their own substance, and the lower would disappear,

and thus the order ol the universe would be subverted. Consequeutly

spiritual and celestial substances‚ while generating their species,

cannot bring them to actual completion. Such compound substances

as the heavens oras man, il their species were made complete, would

do away with all lower substanoes. Consequently‚ the carrying of

species to their complete effect is limited to very lew substances, such

as the elementa, and especially the clement of tire . . . 451-455
'ibe same thing is to be said of attributes or accidents. Some os

these, as hot, sold, moist, dry, can complete their species, especially

the accident of beat. Light also cando this in bodies adapted to it.

Ol colour, odour, savem, and sound the same cannot be said . 455-456

CHAPTER 1.

’ We now have to consider the mode in which the radiation of
species takes place. The first part of the patient, when acted on,
becomes itsels a force acting upon the second part, and so osward.
These successive parts of the patient are of equal dimension. From
the waning-point in the agent, or, which is the same thing, from the
point of the patient first affected, emanate rays in all directions in
straight lines. Those emanations, os whatever kind they be, are
called rays, by analogy with what we see emanating from a star
or any luminous point. Their rectilinear direction continues until
modified by aa opaque sursace which reflects them, or a change of
medium which refracta them. These lines are not merely ol one
dimension: they have breadth, and depth, as well as length . 457-460

CHAPTER 11.

There are five kinds ol rays to be considered. (α) Rectilinear
rays, where the medium is unilonn. (b) Relmcted rays. The ray
passing from a rarer to a denser medium is deflected towards the
perpendimlar drawn to the surlace at that point3 and conversely,
when passing from deaser to rarer. (c) Reflected rays. When the
