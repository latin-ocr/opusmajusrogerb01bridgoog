thing. but a continuous succession, each generating that which follows.
lt has been said that light is body, or an emanation from body. But
Aristotle denies this, remarklng that in that case we should perceive
its translation from east to west at sunrise. The remarks on the
subject in the Topics are not to be taken as conveying Aristotle's

real opinion .......... not-507⁴

CHAPTER ll.

The second question is whether the species of a corporeal agent
should he regarded as corporea} or spiritual. Clearly the former:
since it is not a soul‚ or an intelligence, or a first cause3 and these
only can be considered as spiritual. The species must be of like
nature with the agent, and of like nature with the completed effect.
lt cannot he of nobler nature thau that which generares it. Some hold
that, though in its essence corporeal, yet its tnode of existence is
spiritual. But there cannot he this disparareness between the essence
and the mode of existence. The essence of the species has dimension,
derived as we have seen from the medium ; it is therefore corporeal.
lt is said that it has not material essence (material being here taken
for corporeal). But even spiritual substances have material essence:
they are compounded of form and of matter: much more, there·
fore, are species material. lt hasbeen already shown that the
species of corporeal substance resembles the total compound. ln
the medium not merely is the formal essence generated hut the
material, although the essence be incomplete 1 therefore conclude
that the species of a corporeal object is corporeal . . . sot-509

The contrary view has arisen from imperfect translations of Aver·
roes, Avicenna‚ andAristotle. ln these the word insensible bas been
rnistaken for immaterial. And because spiritual things are insensible,
therefore what is insensible has been taken to mean spiritual and
immaterial. lt is objected that species are not always insensible, as
when a ray passes through a window or through coloured glass Eut
this is only accidental. Some expressions of Avicenna as to the
reception of impressions in the hrain have been wrongly interpreted.
They must be taken in connexion with what Aristotle has said on the

same subject .......... 509-511

CHAPTER 111.

1 pass to the question of the mingling of species in the medium.
The question is one of much difficulty, hut Ptolemy and Alhazen
throw great light upon it. Species of the same kind melt into one,
and if opposite, then the stronger overwhelms the weaker. Those
that are contingent, ie. have no relation to each other, coexist
