honour in bearing it. lt is hard tobepoor. All depends on who is -
the poor man. The birds and beasts do not feel their poverty. The
rich man is but a money-obest. The crowds that follow him are
but as ilies looking for honey, or wolves round a mrcass . 318-319

CHAPTER XIV.

Writing to a lady who had lost her son, Seneca continues, The
mastery of life is only to be seen when trial tests it. Your son
stood this test nobly. Natural affection has its natural limits. The
grief of animals for the loss of those dear to them lasts but a short
time. Men alone grieve long; and even with them it is the weaker
sex, or the more barbarous tribes, who are crushed by it Was this
sorrow unexpected hy you? Remember that none are exempt from
it. Of no earthly possession have we a secure hold. We have them
as actors have their stage properties; the scene ended, they pass
back to the manager. What we have we should be ready to give
up at a moment’s call. ln loving it think of it as even now passing
away. Why weep one part of life when the whole of it is sad i Man‘ ·
is buta frail helpless thing that the most trivial accidents may destroy.
His longest life is but a few years, and may be cut short at any
moment. There are noble instances of constancy under such
calamities as yours, as of the priest engaged in sacrifice who, hearing
of his son’s death, went on calmly with the service. Cornelia, mother
of the Gracchi, Livia and Octavia the sister and the wife of Augustus,
bore their bereavement nobly. Refiect further that life is so un·
certain that the sudden close of it may mean avoidance of calamity
which would otherwise have followed. Nothing is sure but what has
been already done. The sooner we are disentangled from earthly
things the speedier willbe our ilight to the realms above. . 319-322

My reasons for treating this third part of Motal Philosophy at
such length are two. First, that although we are far in advance of
heathen nations in knowledge of spiritual life, we are far behind them
both in word and deed, as to public and private life in this world.
Secondly, the works of Seneca from which l quote have been hitherto

unknown to me, in spite of a long search for them, and probably to
others ............ taneta
