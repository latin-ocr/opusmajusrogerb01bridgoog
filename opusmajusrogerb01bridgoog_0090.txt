MORAL PHILOSOPH Y. lxxxi

opus Masics, that the rise and progress os Greek philosophy
was no less a part oi divine providence than the succession of
the priests and prophets ol' iudaea, he found without surprise

that Aristotle, Plato, Porphyry and others had apprehended,
more or less dimly, some oi the fundamental truths os Christian
theology3 among them being the Trinity, the incarnation, the
existence oi angels and the resurrection of the body. Moral
philosophy, as Bacon conceived it, was in every respect conss
current with theology. ‘De iisdem negotiatur quibus theologia,
licet alio modo! lt is perhaps more surprising that he should
have gathered these truths not merely srom Greek and pre·
Christian writers, but lrom the great Mahommedan teachers,
such as Albumazar, Avicenna, and Algazel. Some ol the
most remarkable passages in the first part os his moral
philosophy are quotations irom Avicenna. More than once
he refers to the passage in which Avicenna, speaking os future
lise in the unseen world, observes: Our present relation to
that lise is like that ol the deas man who never listened to the
delights ol harmony‚ though he never doubted that such
delights existed. Or again : We are like the palsied man to
whom delicious lood is offered which yet we cannot taste till
the palsy be healed. Avicenna tells us how the soul’s vision
is clogged by bodily impubes, and limited by the obtruding
influences ol the visible world; and he insists on the need oi
purging the soul from sin, os concentration oi its forces on
invisible things, andos acceptance os revealed truth. We
may well believe that the attempt to level up Mahommedan
philosophers to the level oi Christian teachers was among the
rmu'tates for which Jerome d'Ascoli cut short Bacon's philo·
sophical career.

The second part oi the Moral Philosophy, dealing with the
laws os civil and social lile, is summarily disposed ol in two
short chapters. Possibly a reason lor this cursory treatment
may be found in Bacon’s aversion to the introduction ol
Roman law, which finds vehement expression in the twenty·
lourth chapter os the Opus Tertium, and again in the Com·
pendium studii (Brewer, pp. 84-87, and 418) ¹.
