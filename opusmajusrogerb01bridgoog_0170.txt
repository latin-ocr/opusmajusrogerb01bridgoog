CHAPTER XII.

ln a discourse addressed to his mother, Seneca has suggested
consolation under every kind 31 calamity. When mislonunes are
many, it is not worth while bewailing any one ol them separately.
We are hardened by the rest, like veteran soldiers who bear their
wounds in silence Seneca alleges his own example under trial
Though not attainingto the level of the truly wisc, he yet has followed ’
wise men’s taching, and so has been lorewarned and lorearmed
against the caprices ol fortune. Take each mislortunesingly. And ,

first ol exile. What is exile but a change of placei 01 the vast
multitudes in Rome is nota large proportion foreign? A gain, is not
constant motion as natural to the mind as it is to the heavenly

bodies? Looking at the human race, we find each part ol it constantly
migrating; and what is migration hut exile? Wherever we go we

Let us remember what Brutus tells us oi the 3113311111 activity 31
Marcellus in exile. Poverty is sometimes added. 11 meat and drink
and clothing are supplied, it is no cause lor complaint that avarice and
gluttony are not satiated. The real necessities ol life are easily
provided. For the rest, the mind is everything3 jewels, gold and

body; the mind they cannot touch. The poor are not less happy
than the rich. But luxury has been carried so far that the travelling
money ol an exile is what once would have been the patrimony 31
princes. Homer had but one servant, Plato three, &no none. But
how 11 all these evils, poverty‚ exile and neglect, he joined together?
The answer is the same. The same reason which supplies endurance
ο1 333 will suffice lor all. As 131 ignnminy, it depends ou him who
eudures it: the prison was 33 honourable place when Socrates was
its inhabitant. When 3 great man is cast down he is venerated
still, as when a stately temple is laid in ruins . . . . till-317

Writing to Gallio, Seneca asks, Is death an eviii All men share it.
