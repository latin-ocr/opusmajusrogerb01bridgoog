xxviii INTRODUCTION.

before 1248, the date of William's death. We know that he
must have been still in France in 125ο, for in that year the
revolt of the Pastoureaux broke out; and Bacon tells us that
he ‘saw their leader walking barefoot in a troup of armed men
carrying something in his hands with the care with which
a man carries a sacred relic’ (Opus Mases, vol. i. p. 401>

For some time between this date and 1257 he was probably
in Oxford. Whether he lectured there publicly we do not
know. But that he incurred the suspicion of his superiors in
the Franciscan Order is certain 3 whether by audacity in specu-
lation‚ by eprperiments looked upon as magical, or by frank
exposure of the ignorance of professorial magnates, cannot be
said with certainty. His old friends and teachers‚ Edmund
Rich and Adam de Matisco, had passed from the scene.
Grosseteste, his revered master, was dead, or died (1253)
shortly after his return, in despair at the corruption of the
Papacy, and half doubting whether Rome had not become
the seat of Antichrist. No one was left to promote the study
of Greek, which for aught we know died out in ‚Oxford till
Erasmus witnessed its revival ln 1255, John of Fidanza,
better known as Bonaventura, became General of the
Franciscan Order, a man of exalted and aspiring mysticism,
eager to revive the spirit of St. Francis, and not likely to
care much for new learning that might lead he knew not
whither. Perhaps it was by'his direction that Roger Bac0n‚
about 1257, was removed from Oxford, and placed under
close supervision in the Paris house

What degree of restriction was placed upon his liberty is
not very easy to define with precision. He was not forbidden
· to write, although he implies that he had not availed himself
of the power to do so to any considerable extent. To multiply
books by copyists was impracticable; first, because copyists
outsidc the Order could not be trusted to make an honest
use of the copies at their disposal; and· secondly, because
a strict prohibition was laid down and enforced against com-
municating any manuscripts to those who were not members

of the Order. When Pope Clement's message reached him
requiring him to transmit his works with the least possible
