Every one who considers Bacon's efforts in promoting the
study of language must agree with Professor Brewer (p. lxii)
that ‘his labours in this respect have attracted less attention
than they deserve. .. . lt is as creditable to his discernment
as to his courage that he ‘should have seen, better than Lord

. Bacon did, the paramouut importance of philology‚ and urged

it repeatedly on his contemporaries. It is amazing to hear
a scholar of the thirteenth century insisting on the necessity of
constant references to original authorities as the only sure
foundation of sacred criticism.’

It may be that Bacon's exhortatione, reiterated as we feel
sure they would be, not in writing merely, but in conversation
with the young men whom he gethered round him, were not
entirely without effect on the following generation. ln the

council convoked in 1312 by Clement V at Vienne, one of
the provisions says Fleury (Hist. Eccl. book 91), was ‘the

establishment in the Roman Curia, and in the Universities of
Paris, Oxford‚ Bologna, and Salamanca, of teachers for the
three languageS, Hebrew, Arabic, and Chaldaean‚ two for
each. They were to be maintained in Rome by the Pope‚ in
Paris hythe Kingof France‚ and in the other cities by the
prelates, bishop5‚ and chapters of the country! This subject
has been carefully studied by Mr. Rashdall in his important
work on the Universities of Europe in the middle ages. He
gives strong authority for the belief that Greek was included ;
and if s0‚ the avowed purpose of the ordinance, which was
the conversion of the Mahommedans and Jews, may not have
been the only purpose ; some faint echo of Bacon’s exhorta-
tion to study Aristotle and the Bible in the original, with the
view of understanding them better, may have been still audible.
Few and short-lived were the attempts made to carry the
decree of this Council into effect. In 1320 we hear of a rate
levied upon benefices in the province of Canterbury for the
support of a converted Jew alleged to be teaching Greek at
Oxford. But Qxford was already passing under the spell of
the enchanter. The line webs of Duns Scotus, which the
