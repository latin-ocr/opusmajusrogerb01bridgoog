xvi PREFACE.

Sloane MS. 2156, and the Harlcian MS. 80, 60b‚
have also been consulted.

The sixth section of the Opus Majus (Sciimtia
Experimentalis) appears to have been seldom copied.
ln the third volume of Baconian MSS. presented to
University College‚ Oxford‚ by John Elmhurst‚ there
is a MS. of this section which is described as copied
from Allen's MSS. (see Brewer, p. xliii). It may,
therefore, be merely copied from the Oxford MS. of
the Opus Majus. But it offers some variants, and in
one or two passages it has proved serviceable. lt is
spoken of in this edition as U.

Of the seventh section, here printed for the first
time, there is a MS. in the Royal Library (8, F. ii)
containing the first two parts and a portion of the
third. This has been carefully collated with the
corresponding parts of the Dublin and Oxsord MSS.
The variations will he seen to be of no great impor-
tance. The MS. appears to be of the middle of the
fifteenth century.

Besides these MSS„ others have been consulted
which throw light on Bacon’s life and work. Chief
amongst these is the important MS. of the Mazarin
library (formerly numbered 1271, but at present 3576),
from which Professor Emile Charles gives copious ex-
tracts in his monograph entitled Roger Bacon, sa vie, ses
ouvrages ses doctrines, dapris des lactes inediis (Bor-
deaux, 1861). More will be said afterwards of its
contents. They offer a considerable instalment of
the Scriptum Principale, of which the Opus Majus,
inclusive of its adjuncts, the Opus Minus and the
Opus Tertium, was but the prelude.

Another valuable fragment of this final work is
preserved in the British Museum among the Sloane
