such as magnitude, position, motion, tic, which are apprehended
by sensus coimmunis, donot. The magnitude and ligure of an object
are inierred from the speeies os light and colour that issue from it; not
by species oi magnitude and figure. Still more obviously is this the

case with properties like proportion‚.relation, and position . tat-430
(gt Os things some are universals, some are particulars3 species
issue lrom both. Universals donot exist apart imm their particulare,
neither do their species.. The species in every case is of the same

natureae the source from which it issues ..... 430 431

CHAPTER Ill.

We have considered the agent 3 we are now to. consider the mode
oi action. lt is not correct to say that the species is something
which issues from or is emitted by the agent. Nor is it created out
ol nothing. Nor again is it an impression made upon the patient as
with a seal upon wax. The true view is that the species results from
a change in the potential activity oi the recipient matter. We must
distinguish between the potentin activa and the potentiis recepliva.
The la'tter is that on which the Creator implants F onn. But it is the
potentia activa which is here in question. The agent produces its

effect, not byunion ol its substance with the patient, but by stimulating
the latent activity oi the matter which is acted on . . ,431-434

Action does not take place at a distance. F orce is not exerted by
the agent except on the part oi the patient with which it is in immediate
contact. The effect generated in the first partos the patient becomes
a force acting on the second, and so onward. Action is thus propa-⁰

lt is objected to this view that a ray oi light passing through
coloured glass produces bright colours on an opaque sereen; how
could such colours be evolved irom the potential activity oi the
intervening air, a simple substance? The reply is that the species
produced in the air is extremely seeble. lt only becomes relatively
strong oo reaching the screen which is so constituted as to develop
colour. ln the same way the species oi the magnetis ieeble until it
reaches tbe iron which is better adapted to receive iu The colour on
the opaque screen is but the species oi colour, and is tar from being
socompleteas it appears ........ 436-438

CHAPTER lV.

Six propositione have now to be considered. (a) lt is not possible
to assign a minimum ol quantity below which a given agent will cease
to act. ln animate agents there is an augmentative power bringing
