nurnero.'’ ln the descending scale from general to special,
each grade of matter, like each grade of form, is distinct from
the preceding. One kind of matter is separated from another
by specific differenoes just as form is separated lrorn form.
The difference between an ass and a horse is not a difference
of form only; it is a difference of matter’ (ι Commun. Natur.'
Part Il. Dist. ii. ch. 6).

Bacon has condensed these views in the diagrammatic form
shown in the subjoined schedules, which Ῑ have copied from
the Mazarine MS. pp. 23, 24. (They have been collated with
those ol the Br. Mus. MS. Royal, 7 F. vii. fol. 91 and 92.
The variants in this MS. for the schedules of substantia cnm-
posita 3ηά forma are unimportant. Those of materia are
omitted; this MS. being in other respecta less perfect than
that of the Mazarine library.)

How are we to estimate these speculations? It is obvious
in the first place that they stand in marked opposition to, or
at least in distinction from, theories current among Bacou's
contemporaries. To judge rightly of them we must bear in
mind that throughout the greater part of the thirteenth
century questions were being agitated of even greater impor-
tance than the controversy between realism and nominalism.
The pantheistic tendencies discernible in Averroes and other
Arabian thinkers had been diffused, as we have seen, by men
like Arnaury and David of Dinant They were responsible,
as some thought, for the disastrous anarchy which early in
the century had devastated southern F rance. Bacon was
quick to perceive the danger of maintaining the unity of
matter. It had been defended, as he points out (Op. Maj. Ι
vol. i. p. 144), by passages from Aristotle which he wishes to
believe had been badly translated. In any case, he says,
‘the error is enormouS, as great as any that can possibly be
found in speculative questions. lf it be granted, it is im-
possible to comprehend the generation of things, and the
whole course of nature will be misunderstood. And what is
more, if this error be looked at closely, it will be found to
tend towards heresy, or rather to be the profanest ol heresies,
since the inevitable result of it is to endow matter with the
