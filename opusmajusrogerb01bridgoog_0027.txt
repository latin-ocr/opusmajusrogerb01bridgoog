temporary writer. Matthew Paris relates‚ under the year
1233, that Henry Ill convoked the counts and barons of the
kingdom to a council at Oxford. Their animosity against
Pierre des Roches, Bishop ol winchester, the king’s chief
advises, who had surrounded his person with a body-guard of
Poitevins and filled England with these foreigners, led them
to refuse the summons. While the king was debating what
measures to take against the recalcitrant barons‚ a Dominican
preacher, Robert Bacon by name, told him srankly that there
would be no hope of permanent peace in the kingdom so long

family was one of some wealth‚ since he himself had been
able to spend much money on experimenta} research. lt
appears also that this family had taken the royal side through-
out the disputes between Henry and his barons, and had
suffered pecuniary loss and exile lor their loyalty. He tells
Pope Clement that, being in sore distress for the money
necessary for the transcription and conveyance of his MSS,
‘ 1 wrote to my brother, a rich man in my country. But he,
belonging as he did to the king's party, was in exile with my

mother, brothers, and the whole family. Ruined and reduced

to utter poverty, he was unable to help me, and up to the
