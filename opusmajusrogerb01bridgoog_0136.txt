On the origin oi the optio nerves Clearly'the iunetion of vision
cannot be understood without a knowledge os the structure oi the eye.
Most writers on Perspective have ignored this part oi the subject,
or contented themselves with a hare reference to work on medicine.
l hope however to make the matter clear by reference to three
authorities—Alhareny Constantine, aud Avicenna. There are two
oevities in the fore part oi the hrain called ventrieies, one on the
right, the other on the left. From. these the optic nerves issue.
They meet and cross; the right nerve passing to the leit eye, and
conversely. ln the hollow oi the eye the nerve spreads itseli out
in spherical form. Each nerve consists oi three coats, the innertnost
derived irorn the pie tuater; outside this is one coming irom the

dura mater; these two are wrapt in a third, coming irom the lining
oi the skuli ........... 12-15

Thus the eye itseli consists oi three coats; containing three
humours, andastructurelikeaspider'sweb(telaaraneae). The inner-
most is called by Avicenna and others the retina, and is supplied with
veins, arteries, and slender nervous fihres3 the second, coming t'rorn the
dura mater, is called the uvea; it has an opening in front through
which light passes. llehind, it is highly vascular: in front it is trans·
parent and is called cornea The third and outermost coat is the
sclerotic, which isfinn and solid. lt is sometimes called consolidativa; ’
it does not extend sotar t'orward as to cover the cornea . . 1516

CHAPTER lll.

The uvea contains three humours, and also a weh-like structure,
arising from its anterior part. A crystallino or glacial substance fiiis
the greater port of the cavity oi the eye; it consists ot' two parts.
The hinder part, in contact with the terminal expansion oi the nerve
is like melted glass, thence called vitreous; the anterior part, which
has received various names, is like ice, hail, or crystal; it is sorne-
what whiter than the vitreous. Anterior to the weh, occupying the
spaoe between it and the cornea, is the third hurnour, somewhat
like the white oi egg. On the mode in which these parts receive
nourishment there is some difference oi opinion. Visiou is dependent

on the crystalline humour, though not eo essentially as on the opha¹ 1ss
nerve . .· .......... -
