xii PREFACE. ’

Majus (Brewer, pp. 38, 99, 117, 227). Itis a treatise
on the propagation ol radiant forces, usually spoken of
as Multz'plicatz'o Specr'erum, but in one passage entitled
T ructatus de Rodiis, quem vobis misi separatim ab
Opere Majori. ln the present edition this treatise
will be found in its proper place as an appendix to the
Opus Majus.

lt must be added that the text, as edited, is in
certain parts of the work far from perfect. This
remark applies especially to the third 3ηά sixth sections.
ln the third section ‘several missing pages have been
supplied srom a Cottonian MS. (Julius D.v.), con·
tainiug amongst other things a Greek and a Hebrew
alphaber. Itis the more remarkable that Jebb should
have omitted these passages, since it is clear that he
had consulted this MS. and had made frequent correc-
tions srom it. The sixth sectiou, on Experimental
Science‚ has been so carelessly edited that it seems
probable that the editor must have entrusted the
work to a less competent assistant Contractions of
the most ordinary kind are misinterpreted (as e. g.
‘e converso' is rendered ‘ergo' ‘conclusio' is written
‘quaestio' dte), 3ηά in some passages sentences have
· been omitted. While iudicating these shortcomiugs‚
it ought at the same time to be added that other
· parts os the work give proof os great labour and care
in the collation ol the MSS. consulted. This is

especially the case with the fourth 3ηά filth parts,
which sorm a very large proportiori ol the whole work.
Having spent much time over the MSS. used by Jebb,
in addition to others, Ι can bear testimony to the
accuracy with which variatious have here been noted.
All os them which are ol more than verbal importance
have been noted in the present edition.
