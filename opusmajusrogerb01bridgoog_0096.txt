vol. ii. p. 389.)

In Bacon’s demonstration of the superiority of Christianity
to other religions, use is made of this singular experiment.
The majority of those who took part in it accepted the unity
of God. The Pagans were few in number. The Buddhists
(spoken of as ldolaters) raised the question of the origin of
evil as an objection to a single ruler of the Universe3 but
they allowed the question to be evaded. The Tartars, though
somewhat indifferent on religious matters, were‘ disposed to

side with the Mahommedans and Christians in maintaining ·

the unity of God. On the whole, the conclusion to which
this conference tended was a fair sample, in Bacon’s judgement,
of the preponderating voice of mankind.

Appeal is then made to Aristotelian reasoning as to the
necessity of a First Cause. The attributes of wisdom and
goodness are shown to follow from omnipotence. Man's duty
being to do God’s will, howis man to know it? Evidently
by revelation. And which revelation is true? There can be
but one: for if there were more the human race could not
be united. ‘The unity of the Church follows from the unity
of God. lf there were more Gods than one, more worlds
than one, and more mankinds than one, then there might be
more revelatione than one, but not otherwise’ Which, then,
is the true revelation? On a comparison of the six religione
before us, three, the Pagan, the Buddhis't, and the Tartar, are
at once ruled out. Of the three that remain, the Jewish, the
Saracen, and the Christian, philosophie reasoning, external
and miraculous evidence, and ethical purity combine in giving
preference to the last. The book, as we have it, closes
with some ardent and rapturous words on the Sacra·
ment of the Altar, as the means whereby Christ always
remains present with His Church.

Of the missing books we are not left in entire ignorance.
We know from the fourteenth chapter of the Opus Tertairm
that thc purpose of the fifth book was, to insist upon such
modes of setting forth moral truth as were likely to impress,
not merely the intellect‚ but the emotious and character of
