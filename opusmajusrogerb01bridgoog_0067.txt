had possibly seen and studied; though he makes no mention
ol it, in any work known to us ¹.

Astrology and astronomy come next The first is the
speculative branch, dealing with planetary motions, with the
figure of the earth and ol its various regions. Astronomy‚
the practical branch, has to do with the construction ol tables
and with the lorecast os future events. Bacon admits that this
use ol the words has not been universally adopted, but main7
tains its correctness. ‘Astrologia componitur ex hoc nomine
astron quod est stella, et hoc nomine logos quod est verbum,
vel ratio, vel sermo. quia est sermo de stellis. Astronomia vero
dicitur lex stellarum et nomos est lex. Unde quia lex univer-
saliter sonat in practicum‚ ut in morali philosophia lex est ipsa
practica, ita similiter Astronomia est practica astronomiae.'

In the fourth division music is considered. This includes ἰ
not merely sound but gesture. Audible music is considered
under the two heads ol vocal and instrumental. In the vocal
division every branch ol elocution is included. Finally, the
effectos music on the temper and health both ol men aud ol
animals should be systematically studied.

Abstraction is the subject of the fisth division. First we
have the abstraction common to all science, since science
deals with universals‚ not with particulare. There is then the
abstraction ol a first cause from secundary causes andos spirit
lrom body, which the metaphysician deals with. Mathematical
abstraction has to do with the study of quantity apart lrom
the substance to which it belongs: apart from all natural
changes such as growth, diminution or change ol place.

This first part closes with an explanation ot' the disserence
between axioms, postulates, and definitions.

The second part begins with the study ol whole numbers
and fractions: passing irom this to the subject of arithmetical,
geometrical, and harmonic ratio, and to the question ol pro·
portion generally. Continuous and discontinuous proportion
are considered3 and Euclid’s definition ol proportion is care-
lully considered.
