PREFACE. xvii

MSS. (2156). lt contains the first book and part of

the second of the Communia Mathematicae. Attention
was called to it both by Brewer and by Charles, and
occasional references to it have been made in the
present edition.

Yet a third fragment is the elementary work on
Greek grammar in the possession of Corpus Christi
College, Oxford, which was sent to the Bodleian for
my perusal. Αη imperfect copy, in seventeenth cen·
tury handwriting, apparently made from the Corpus
MS.. is contained among the Boconian MSS. of
University College.

Bacon’s commentary on the Secrelum Sardorum
(Tanner MSS. 116) has also been examined. lt throws
light on the astrological side of his work.

Among the books consulted for this edition, far the
most important are those of Professors Brewer and
Emile CharleS, already spoken of. lt is unfortunate that
two such assiduous and able investigators should have
worked simultaneously and without communication.
Several not unimportant errors might have been
avoided, had either of them known of the other's
work. Charles had a far more extensive knowledge
than Brewer of Bacon's unpublished works; and his
extracts from them are so copious as to render it
desirable that his monograph, which has already
become extremely rare, should be republished. He
makes, however, the erroneous statement (p. 62) that
the missing portion of the Opus Mojus (here printed
for the first time) had been publishcd in Dublin; and
he does not appreciata the distinction, so clearly
demonstrated by Professor Brewer, between the Opus
7 'entium (which is at once an introduction and a supple·

ment to the Opus Majus), and the far vastet Scriptum
vor. 1. b
