way that was possible, by borrowing weapons from berlay ‘
rival, and arranging her own system of law in a sorm not
less comprehensive and systematic. Irnerius had hardly
finished his lectures when a sellowcitizen, the monk Gratian,
in ¹143 published his great text-book of canon law known
as the Decretum, to which, in 1234, Gregory IX added five
books of Decretals.

Nominally the situation was saved, but at the eost ol
secularizing the Church. For the canon law was in reality
based on the civil law. ‘Everything in the canon law was
Roman which was notos directly Christian or Jewish origin!
'After the age os Gratian the studies even ol ecclesiastics
took a predominantly legal turn. Speculative theology was
abandoned in favour os the canon and even ol the civil law3
while the estrangement os the canon law from theology
kept pace with the increasing closeness oi its union with
the faculty os civil law’ (Rashdall, i. p. 138). In 1219
Honorius 111 sormally prohibited the study ol civil law in
Paris on the ground that it threatened to extinguish the study
ol theology in the one great theologica} school ol Europe.
But prohibitions that were powerless to exclude Aristotle
were equally impotent against the invasion os Ulpian and
Justinian.

Bacon’s pages reflect very vividly the conflict ol clerical
with secular influences. ‘More praise’ he says, ‘is gained in
the Church of God by a civil jurist. though he may know
nothing but civil law and be utterly ignorant os canon law
and theology, than by any master in theology,and he is more
quickly promoted to high ecclesiastical positions.’ ‘Oh that
the canon law might be purged from the superfluities of civil
law, and be ordered by theology,’ he exclaims‚ ‘then would
the govemment os the Church be carried on honourably and
suitably to ita high position' (Opus Τ atium, ch. 24).

He recurs to th'e same subject in a later worlc ‘F or the last
forty years the abuse os the civil law ol Italy has been under·
mining not merely the study os philosophy, but the Church of
God, and all the kingdoms os Christendom.' ‘They monopo-
