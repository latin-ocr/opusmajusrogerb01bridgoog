lronr withstanding passions by lree will. Hence, astrologers
themselves say that the wise man govems the stars‚ in so lar,
namely, as he governs his own passions’ Further on, in
Prima Secundae, quaest. ix. art. 5, this subject is again dis·
cussed. The question asked is, ‘Can will be influenced by
a heavenly body ?' The conclusion is, ‘Since will is a faculty
absolutely immaterial and incorporeal, it can only be in-
fluenced by heavenly bodies indirectly.' And in his comment
Aquinas observes, ‘So lar as will is influenced by any out-
ward object, it can evidently be influenced by heavenly
bodies: since all externa} bodies, which, when presented to
the senses, move will, and even the very organs of sensitive
laculties, are influenced by the motions of the heavens. But
there is no direct action of heavenly bodies upon the will.
For the will, as Aristotle says (De Α m'ma, lib. iii) resides in
reas0n; and reason is a power ol the soul not bound to
a bodily organ.. ..On the other hand. he adds, ‘ Sensitive
appetite is the sunction (actus) ol a bodily organ. Wherelore
nothing hinders impressions of celestial bodies lrom rendering
some men apt to anger, or to lust, or to some passion ol this
kind3 and thus lrom natural complexion many men follow
passions‚ and wise men alone withstand them. And s0‚ in
a general way, are verified those things that are foretold of
the actions ol men in accordance with the consideration
of heavenly bodies,¹

Now the view taken by Bacon coincides precisely with that
os Aquinas. Confusion, he says (Opus Majus‚ p. 150), had
arisen in the matter in consequence ol the equivocal meaning

ol the word, Mathematics sometimes held to be derived from ”

μαντική, sometimes from μάθησις. The characteristic, he says,
os false mathematic‚ was to assert that through the powers of
the constellatione all things took place ol necessity. No place
was left for contingent matter, lor judgement, lor sree will.
Such a view of nature was condemned not only bytheologians
but by philosophers. Aristotle and Plato, Cicero and Pliny.
Avicenna and Albumazar were unanimous in holding that
lree will remained uncoerced by the motions ol heavenly
bodies. ‘True mathematicians and astrologers lay down no
