CHAPTER l.

The eye approaches the most periect oi geometricali inmas, the
sphere. But between the various humours there are important t
differences oi form. The crystalline is a portion of a sphene oi
different curvature ironr the vitreous. The centre oi curvature oi
the vitreous is situated lurther sorward on the axis ol the eye3 that
oi the crystalline further backward The cornea has the same centre
asthe globe nithe eye The sante maybesaid nithe liquor albugineus
The centre oi the uvea is anterior to that ot' the cornea .’ 1820

CHAPTER 11.

lt must be rememberedthat, in speaking oi these bodies as spherical,
we have only to deal with sections of spheres‚ relating to those parts
oi the eye concerned with the passage oi light. ln other parts these
structores are not necessarily oi sphericaiiorrn . . . . Ml

CHAPTER 111.

The centre oi the consolidativa is generally placed further back
than that oi the other parts. The truth is that it is not oi strictly
spherica] iorm,neither is its inner suriace concentric with the outer.
lt is oi irregular spheroid form, somewhat prolate on the iorward
surlace But the central points ot ail these ocular structores lie on
one straight line, as the figure shows ...... 21-25

CHAPTER 1.

The cornea doses the opening in the uvea, and prevents the
escape ol the aqueous. Being transparent it allows the passage
oi luminous impressions. lt is strong enough to resist iuroads oi
air and oi dusty particles irorn without, being made up ot' four
layers The aqueous is also transparent: its moisture prevents
the crystalline and iris from getting too dry. The uvea is usually
black, so that leeble impressione of light and colour may produce
their iull effect. lt is however, from various causes, sometimes

grey. The colour oi the eye depende on this structure . . 2Ηῖ
