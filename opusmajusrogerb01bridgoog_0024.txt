lu the July issue oi the English Hr'slon'cal Reuiew, 1897,
Dr. Gasquet publishes a MS. ol Bacon which he has found
in the Vatican, and which he inclines to think is a presace
to the Opus Majus.

There is much to justiiy this view. The work in question
describes Bacon’s overssowing gratitude sor Pope Clement's
message to him; apologizes lor the delay in the transmission
ol his works by pointing out that none oi these works were
in a complete state; epplains the obstacles interposed by the
distress os his family, ruined in the civil warS, and by the re·
strictions oi his Order; introduces his disciple John, who had
been sor seven years under his tuition; and finally concludes
with a briei summary ol the contents ol the Opus Majus. This
he describes, not as his principa! work, but as a Persuasrb.
lt has seven parts. After briessy noting the contents ol the
first two, Bacon passes to the seventh (published sor the first
time in this edition) and then comments successively on the
sixth, fifth, fourth, and third.

lt will be observed by readers ol this short treatise that it
contains little that is not set lorth with much greater sullness
in the Opus Tertium, which is to be regarded as the real
Introduction to the collection ol writings sent by Bacon in
1267 to Pope Clement IV. The first chapter of Dr. Gasquet‘s
MS. is almost exactly identical with pp. 7-12 in Brewer’s edition
os Opus Tertiam, the latter, however, having certain sentences
not contained in the former. The fiith chapter is a repetition
ol Opus MajuS, pt i. cap. 16. One or two sentences, however,
ol this newly published work deserve attention. We leam
srom it that Bacon's lise in Paris between 1257 and 1267 was
a time ol comparative inaction: a decem annis propter languores
