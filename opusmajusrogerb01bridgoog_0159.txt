horizon The arcs wisible are not portions of the same circle. When
the sun is high, and a small arc is visible, it belongs to a larger circle
than the arc seen when the sun is rising or setting. A bow can be
seen when the sun is just below the horizon ; but owing to terrestrial
vapours, only the crown of the archisusuallyseen . . . 178-181

ln some latitudes there can be no rainbow at noon even in the
winter solstice. When the latitude (i. e. the distance from the zenith
to the equator) is 24⁰ 25¹, the sun’s altitude at noon in the winter
solstice will be 42⁰, therefore there can be no bow. Passing north
from this latitude, there can always be a noon rainbow till we corne to
latitude 66⁰ 25', when at the winter solstice there is no sun. Similar
calculationscan be made for other latitudes . . . . 181-185

CHAPTER Vll.

We have now to inquire whether the iris comes from incident, ·
reflected‚ orrefracted rays. ls the bow an image of the suni Are
the colpurs on the clouds real? Why is the iris of circular form?
llere we call experiment to our aid. We find on trial that if we move
in'a direction parallel to the rainbow it follows us witha velocity
exactly equal to our own. If we approach it, it recedes: if we
recede, it follows. The same phenomenon occurs with respect to the
sun. We have seen that the sun is always opposite the rainbow; the
line between the contre of the bow and the centre of the sun passing
through the eye of the observet. If the sun were apparently
stationary, this would involve the bow moving much faster than the
observet, the latter rnoving through the satne angle, but at less
distance from the apex. But this is not so.' lberefore there isan
apparent motion of the sun concurrently with that of the bow. ‘l’he
case is analogous to what happens when a hundred men are ranged
in line facing the sun. Each sees the sun in front of him. Their
shndows seem parallel, though we know that in reality they must
diverge yet owing to the vast distance of the sun this divergence is
imperceptible. We are thus brought to the conclusion that, supposing
a rainbow to occur, each of the hundred men, facing backwards,
would see a different rainbow, to the centre of which his own shadow
would point. The rays causing the iris are therefore not incident
ruys, otherwise the colour would appear fixed in the cloud. And for
the same reason they are not refracted mys, for in refraction the
image does not follow the change of place of the observer, as is the
case here One condition of the phenontenon is that the atmosphere
shall be more illuminated at the standpoint of the obsewer, and less
