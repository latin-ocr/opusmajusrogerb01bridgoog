we can lose : and the rich bear losses quite as badly as the poor. 01
this Diogenes was well aware, when he took to a 1113 01 voluntary
poverty. There can be no more doubt 01 his happiness than 01 the

happiness 01 God. When his oue slave 1311 him he merely remarked
that 11 1113 slave could do without him surely 113 could do without the
slave. Our wisdom is 10 reduce the number 010111 wants, 10 be
content witha moderate fortune, and to *live well within it Even in
intellectual pursuits there should be the same moderatiori. Vast
collections 01 books are 01 small avail, monuments 01 luxury rather

worse than idle. Let us 1311313 from too many occupations; our
disappointment will be the less. Let us take the work that comes to
