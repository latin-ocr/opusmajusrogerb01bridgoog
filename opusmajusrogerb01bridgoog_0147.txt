cxxxviii ANALYSIS OF THE ‘OPUS rmus]

vomi. raons
lrom the eye are strong enough to penetrate it when near; not so
when distant. We must conceive the pencil ot' rays from the object
aud that from the eye as having a common axis drawn through the
various ocular centres; this central line being specially potent in
vision. The point at which it strikes 'the object is seen with
clearness; adjacent points also, in proportion'to their proximity.

The axis ot' the eye is directed successively to each point in the

object. The eyes act in concert, their axis being directed to the same
point ............ 92-94

CHAPTER 11.

When one of the eyes is pushed hythe finger lrom its proper
position, the angle of vision ceases to be the same lor both os them,
and the object appears double. So too when the eyes are lixed on a
given point, an object placed between that point and the eye, or
beyond that point, will appear double. lt is easy to demonstrate this
byexperiment .......... itt-95

CHAPTER ΙΙΙ.

Further experiments on double vision may be made lt' the finger
be held between the eye and a candle, and the eyes be fixed on the
candle‚ the finger will appear double. Is the right eye be closed, the
leit image will disappear. lt however the light be very distant,

the result is different. The right image vanishes on closiog the right
eye ............. 96-97

CHAPTER lv.

Agaim the axes of each eye may make such an angle with the
common axis ol vision as to produce a double image. Or the direction
os any point in the object of vision may make such an angle with the
axes ol the eyes that the point is seen double . . . ,vt-99

CHAPTER 1.

Let us consider further the three modes ol perception, through sense,
through recollection‚ and through argument, in reference to the eight
conditione ol vision. Ligbt and colour are appreciated through sense
only: and this without error, so long as the right conditione of vision
are lullilled without excess or desect. Starlight is not seen by day
because ol excess ol solar light. Diminish the latter, as by descending
to the bottom osa well, and the stars are seen. The Millry way,
