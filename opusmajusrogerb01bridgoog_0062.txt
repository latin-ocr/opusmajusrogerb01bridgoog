patronage he visited Spain, and translated from the Arabis·
many ol Aristotle’s works, with the comments ol Averroes.
Albertus Magnus says ol him that he was ignorant ol natural
things, and that he did not thoroughly understand Aristotle's
books. Bacon, who speaks os the impression produced in
the schools when he appeared in 1230, with translations of
Aristotle’s metaphysical and scientific treatises, says that he
was ignorant ol words and ol things, and that the greater
part ol his work was due to Andrew the Jew. Scot’s transla-
tion οἱ Avicenna's treatise De Animalibus, as l have remarked
in a note (vol. ii. p. 85), ⁸certainly seems to bear out this
severe judgement. Hermann, the German, was personally
known to Bacon; he worked in Spain, and with the help ol
Arab interpreters, produced translations os the Rhetoric‚
Poetic, and Ethic ol Aristotle. He mentions incidentally
(Jmcrdain, p. 140) that Grosseteste had produced a more
complete rendering os the Ethic directly from the Greek.
Hermann, in answer to some questions put to him by Bacon as
to Aristotle's logical works, srankly conlessed his ignorance ol
logie. ‘Nor was he well acquainted,’ Bacon continues, ‘with
Arabic, being rather an encourager ol translations than a
translator himsell3 the principal part of his work was done
by Saracens in his employment' (Compend. S mdii, cap. 8).
William the Fleming (os Moerbeke) had the advantage
over these men that he translated directly lrom the Greek.
His work is believed to have bee'n done at the special request
ol Thomas Aquinas, who made use ol it in his Commentaries
on Aristotle. ‘But it was notorious in Paris,' says Bacon, ‘that
William ol Moerbeke was totally ignorant ol science, and his
translations are consequently lull ol errors’ On the whole.
he concludes that it would have been better that Aristotle
should never have been translated, rather than that such
a mass ol error should be propagated under the shelter ol his
name. Had l the power os disposing ol these works, 1 would
have them all bumt: it'is a waste ol time to study them,
a source ol error and ol diffusion ol ignorance greater than
can be described.¹ ‘Aristotle's works,’ he continues, ‘are the
foundation ol all wisdom, but they must be studied in the
