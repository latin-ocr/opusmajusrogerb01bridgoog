out an almost exact correspondence in their errors and
in their variants. The Oxford MS. has therefore been
taken as the foundation of the present edition, and
is denoted by the letter O. lt is, however, by no
means perfect, especially in the second and third
sections of the work: and recourse was had both by
Jebb and by the present editor to various MSS. in
the British Museum and elsewhere to supply the
imperfections. Foremost among these are the two
Cottonian MSS, Julius D.v., and Tiberius C.v. (desig-
nated here as Jul. and Tib). The first of these,
unfortunately much injured in the fire of 1731, gives
the first three sections of the work and a large part of
the fourth. The second gives the whole of the fourth.

For the geographical portion of the fourth section,
l was allowed to consult the MS. in the possession of
Corpus Christi College‚ Cambridge. lt is not, how·
ever, believed to be of earlier date than the middle or
later part of the fifteenth century. Occasional reference
has been made to a MS. of the fifth section of the work
(Perspectz'va) in the possession of Magdalene College‚
Cambridge, which l was permitted to examine. lt is
not, however, of earlier date than the Bodleian MS,
and its variants are not of great importance.

Of the MSS. of the Perspecliva and of the Dc
Multiplicatione Specicrum which appear to have been
transcribed more frequently than other portions of the
work, by far the most important is the British Museum
MS. (Royal, 7 F. viii), already spoken of as contem-
porary, or nearly so, with Bacon. This, as l have said,
was carefully collated by Jebb, who indeed has in
certain places copied on the margin extracts from
Combach's printed edition of the Perspecliva of 1614.
The diagrams of this MS. are of special value. The
