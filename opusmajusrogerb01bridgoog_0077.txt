lxviii INTRODUCTION.

the undulatory theory. He formally rejects the contrasted
theory of emission. The species, like the vave, is a motion
or change in successive portions of the aerial or ethereal
medium3 occupying time in its transit: propagated so long
as the medium be homogeneous, in direct lines; liable to
deflection when the medium alters its character.

ln Bacon's theory of the radiation of forces two very
important points are to be noted. The first is his clear grasp
of the principle that time was occupied in their transmission.
He discusses, in the passages already cited, the view of Aristotle

and others that the propagation of light differed from that of
sound and odour by being instantaneous. We might admit,
Aristotle had said, that light could pass through short spaces
without our being able to detect any interval of time during
the passage. But when light passes from east to west through

the universe, the space is so vast that if time were occupied
we could not fail to detect it. Bacon's conception of the
subject is far more scientific. Our inability to perceive minute
intervals of time is no evidence, he said, for their non-existence.
Imperceptible time, he remarks has many degrees. There
is, first, the interval of time occupied by a single propagation
of force (or, as we should say, undulation) followed by the
interval of rest before the next propagation begins. Take
such a multiple of that interval as would suffice for the whole
distance between the extremities of a diameter of the universe,
and that multiple may still remain below the limits of our
power of perception. It is interesting to compare with this
passage the speculatione of the second Bacon on the same
subject (Nou. Org. ii. 46). Francis Bacon had formed the
conjecture that the transit of light from the stars occupied
tirne. But he did not grasp this conjecture with the same
firmness as Roger Bacon‚ and he follows it up with ingenious
arguments which explain it away.

Radiant force, in Bacon’s view, proceeded independently of
man's power to perceive it. Opaque bodies, he observes,
offered resistance to the passage of a luminous ray (De Mul .
Spcc. p. 478; see also vol. i. p. 114). But ‘no substance is so
dense as altogether to prevent rays from passing. Matter
