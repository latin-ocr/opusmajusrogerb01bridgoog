shared by those who have been recreated This sacrament is a con-

tinual renewal of the sacrifice by which Christ has taken away the

sins of the world. lle who made the original sacrifice will be willing

to renew it ........... arctoo
But it is not enough ior reason to be convinced in this matter 3 it

is necessary that the heart be stirred. We must leel that this sacra·

ment' contains in itseli the highest good, the union os man with

God. We must feel that in every Church, lor each recipient who

is in the state os grace, in every part ol the Sacred Host, the whole
Deity is contained. Thus humanity transcends itself‚ and ceases to
be bound withinthe limits of space and time. To the priest is
given in this Sacrament a lar greater power than that ot creating

a universe. The utterance ol five words brings the Creator into
communion with us. Again, what would be impossible to sense, to
sustain the presence oi God, is thus rendered possible St. Dionysius
was not able to endure the sight even os the Holy Virgin. How
then could we endure the Divine presence? Even under the veil,
ol this sacrament the heart is overwhelmed. Only when thus veiled
would it be possible ior us to eat ol Christ's flesb and drink His
blood. We are thus prepared to believe that all our truest blessings
lie in a world beyond the world of sense. We are thus made one
with God and Christ3 and to what greater good than this oon man
aspire? ........... 400-404
