two appendages to that work. Unlortunately the only text
of the Opus Minus which we possess has come down to us, not
merely incomplete. but in so corrupt a state as to render it
olten very difficult to decipher Bacon’s meaning. Enough
remains‚ however, to show the large and comprehensive spirit
in which Bacon regarded the subject.

The contempt expressed in much modern writing for
mediaeval alchemy might be well retorted on its authors.
Admit that some prosecutors ol the occult art were deceivers
as well as deceived‚ and that others were impelled by wild
hopes of gain, has the pursuit ol physical science in modern
times been wholly free from similar taints? Electricity
applied to medicine has been a lertile field sor impostore.
And will any one maintain that the pursuit ol chemistry has
not been stimulated by hopes ol industrial profit? Yet such
things are not allowed to cast a shade on the names ol
a Lavoisier,a Dalton‚ ora Faraday. Alchemy was chemistry
in its prescientihc period. Under the guidance oi hypotheses
which were not nearly so wild or crude as they at first appear,
it attacked, like the true science which gradually grew lrom
it, the important problem of the transmutation ol matter by
artificia} agencies. lt took lor granted that metals were
compound bodies, the elements ol which might be separated
and recomposed. This was no unreasonable supposition.
Indeed‚ until modern spectrology had shown that the vapour ol
many metals existed undecomposed in the intense heat ol the
sun’s atmosphere, there was no adequate reason lor abandon-
ing the attempt to decompose them. lt would be hard to
find in alchemy any conjecture more baseless than that ol
Phlogiston‚ the subtle spirit ol dame, the loss ol which¹ by
combustion made the oxide heavier than the metal. Yet
Priestley accepted this hypothesiS, and a Lavoisier was needed
to destroy it

Alkimia, as conceived by Bacon‚ fell into two great divi-
sione-speculative and operative. Under the latter was
included the metallurgy ol the gold-seelrers‚ and generally
all the practical and industrial processes pursued, with more
or less wisdom‚ by men who had a definite purpose in view-
