The beauty oi the subject, and the rarity ol the books treating of it
explain the length oi the preceding part. 1 now pass to the grounds
ior accepting the Christian religion, which points the way to happiness
in a future lile, and thus gives a meaning and a purpose to moral
philosophy. God has never lest men without the means ol salva·
tion; hence we find ancient philosophers, and especially Aristode,
considering what are the principles which preserve or destroy
states ............ esest?

The religions now existing in the world are those os Saracens,

' Tartars, Pagans, ldolaters (Buddhists), Jews, Christians. They
are distinguished not merely by opinion, but also by difference
ol moral aim. The Saracens permit excessive indulgence iu sexual
pleasures. The Tartars err from lust ol power3 as we leam from
the travels ol William Rubmquis. Their mode ol life is coarse
and rude. The Pagans live by custom rather than reason, and
suppose that their present enjoyments will be continued in a luture
lile. The ldolaters resemble thern in this, except that their priests
practise chastity and abstinence. The Jews combined spiritual with
tempora] blessings; the latter as well as the former belonging to the
future lile. The Christians, while accepting temporat wealth in the
present life, are wholly independent of it in the future . . 367-370

Os these sects we may place the Pagans lowest; they are gulded
by no priesthood, and each lollows his own way. The ldolaters
have a priesthood and a ritual; but they have a multiplicity of gods.
The Tartars corne third ; they worship one God, though with many
superstitious and cruel observances. Next in order come the Jews,
ol whom the more spiritual attalned to the knowledge ol the true
Chn'st Fifth come the Christiane, who practise the Jewish law
spiritually. Finally‚ there is the law of Antichrist‚ which lor a time ’
overwhelms all others. And each os these has its own moral
principle—pleasure‚ wealth, ambhion, lame, or blessedness in a future
lile. ln the mathematica} section ol this work it has been shown that
there is a connexion between these sects and the various planetary
influences‚ which incline men's characters in certain directions, though
without depriving them ol free-will. As these influences change, each
ol the sects maybe moditied by the others. So the Saracens, though
mainly under the influence oi Venus, are modified by Jewish and
