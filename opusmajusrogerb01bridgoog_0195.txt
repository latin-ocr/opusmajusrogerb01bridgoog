refracted ray is stronger than the reflected‚ its path lying nearer to
the direct perpendicular ray. The ray refracted by passage from
a denser to a rarer medium is less potent, lor the same reason, than
the ray refracted from rarer to denset. ln the‘oese ol reflected rays‚
those that make an angle with the vertical line produce a greater
effect than those that fall vertically3 not merely because they diverge

less t'rom the direct ray, but because they can be accumulated hy
suitahly shaped mirrors. Some ol these are described, though

l have not myseli seen them, which bring rays to a locus both in iront
and behind them ......... 534-589

CHAPTER 111.

Cones οἰ rays come lrom the agent to each part os the sursace
acted on. The shorter the cone, the stronger is the action. The
shortest cone is thus defined. Let a circle be drawn in the agent
sphere dividing its operative from its inoperative part From any
points in the circumference of this circle let diameters ol the sphere
be drawn. Tangents to the sphere at the extremities ol these
diameters will torm the shortest cone. Other points connected
with this subject are illustratedby the accompanying diagrams . 539-548

PART Vl.

CHAPTER 1.

As species are generable, so are they corruptible And this
in two ways: (1) frona exhaustion os their own strength; (a) from
, tendency in the substance acted on to resort to its own natural

condition ........... 544-545

CHAPTER 11.

When the generating agent is removed, does the species at once
disappearl Not instantaneously, hut gradually, from the causes stated
in the previous chapter. The apparent permanenoe in some cases of
the species, atterere agent has disappeared, is to be explained. The
semen retains its force in the absence of the male parent3 but here
the female supplies the place. A heated stone retains its beat. Here
the species, ie. incompleta effect, has passed into a more complete
effect ............ 545·547

CHAPTER 111.

Are the reiterated actions of the agent on the patient to be regarded
as numerically identical, oras distinct? They must be regarded as
