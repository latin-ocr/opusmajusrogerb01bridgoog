It is too often lorgotten that Bacon was a schoolman;
trained in scholastic methods, and ready to take part in the
philosophie discussions which interested his contemporaries.
lt is not perhaps surprising that this side of his work should
have been ignored3 lor in the Opus Musas, though visible
enough to an attentive reader, it is thrown into the shade by
the prominence given to positive science, and by the practical
application ol science to political and religious purposes.
Certain chapters ol the Opus Tertium, which supplement too
hasty or imperfect treatment in the larger work (chapters
38—52), aliord better illustrations ol Bacon's aptitude lor
metaphysical discussion. Nevertheless, the position ol Baeon
in the scholastic controversies of the thirteenth century
remained an unknown quantity till the appearance os Professor
Charles's monograph. - His comprehensive survey ol Bacon’s
unpublished works includes a carelul study os, and copious
' extracts from the important fragment ol the Scriptum Princi-
pale, entitled ‘Communia Naturalium,' ol which copies exist
in th'e Mazarine library in Paris and in the British Museum.

Haurdau's comprehensive work on Scholastic Philosophy has
made it easy to relute the illusion‚ still, however,not entirely dis·
sipated, that scholasticism implies a special set ol philosophical
tenets'or an uniformmethod ol treatment. Philosophicalwriters
in the thirteenth century differed frorn one another no less than
philosophical writers in the nineteenth3 though in either case
a certain similarity in the subjects considered, and in the mode
ol handling them, was impressed by the circumstances of the
time. Scholastlc philosophy means simply philosophy taught
in mediaeval schools. And between the schools os the twellth,
ol the thirteenth, and os the lourteenth centuries, there were
great and essential differences.
