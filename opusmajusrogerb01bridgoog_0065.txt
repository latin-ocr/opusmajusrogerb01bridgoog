l'rincipale‚’ which there is reason lor thinking that Bacon
had already hegun, but which he regretlully expresses his
inability to send at such short notice. Hence though it deals‚
osten very cursorily, with every department of knowledge
then recognized, we must not infer Bacon's ignorance of

a subject from the lact that this provisional treatise makes
no mention orit.

Among the fragments of the ‘Scriptum l'rincipale’ which
have come down to us, is a portion of the first book on
Mathematics, preserved among the Sloane MSS. (2156). This
first book contained three parts. We have the first part ol
this book, and a considerable part ol the second. A lew
fragments more are to be lound in the Bodleian (Digby MSS.
76). As lar as I am aware nothing more is extant.

The first part deals with preliminary principles (ι quaedam
preambula ad interiora mathematicae ').

lt has five divisions or distinctions. The subjects dealt
with are the relation ol mathematic to metaphysic: its dis·
tinction from magic3 the hindrances to its culture offered by
the lour causes ol error, viz. salse conceit ol wisdom‚ authority,
custom, and popular prejudice3 the utility ol mathematics‚ its
importance to the preliminary studies of logie and grammar.
The final chapter ol this section is curious. The final purpose,
says Bacon, ol logie is conviction. But conviction is not
reached by argumentative process alone, but by the arts ol
rhetoric and poetry‚ which are therefore in a true sense
departments ol logie. But these arts are govemed by the
laws ol music, which isa branch of mathematical science.

The second division deals with the definition of the parts
of quantity. Certain general terms‚ such as simultaneity in
space and time, linit, continuity‚ infinity‚ dimension, are
explained. The distinction is drawn between continuous and
discrete quantity. Continuous quantity in one, two, and three
dimensions is defined. Discrete quantity is distinguished into
what is permanent, as number3 what is not permanent, as
sound.

The third division expounds the distinction between the
speculative and the practicnl departments ol geometry and
