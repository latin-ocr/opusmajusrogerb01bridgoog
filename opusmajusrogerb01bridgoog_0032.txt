BA CON'S LIFE. xxvii

of the two works, separated as they are by an interval of
more than three centuries‚ shows undoubted and weighty
obligations of Gilbert to his predecessor. In the construction
of globular magnets (the ‘ terrella‚’ or model of the earth), in
the mode of finding their poleS, ,the procedure, and indeed
the very language of Peter, is closely followed by the later
inquirer.

To a mind so original as Bacon’s, trained in scientific method
by Grosseteste and other members of the English mathe-
matical school, the influence of an experimental thinker
like Peter of Maricourt must have been stimulating in the
extreme. Bacon was thirsting for reality in a barren land
infested with metaphysical mirage. From the horse-load of
verbal controversies contained in the Summa of Alexander
of HaleS, from the interminable series of tedious commentaries
on Aristotle‚ of which so great a master as Albert was setting
the first fatal example, he took refuge in the visions of the
harvest of new truth that was to be reaped by patient observa-
tion of Nature, by submission of her processes to experimental
questioning, by following the lowly paths used by plain men
in their daily avocationS. ‘ The wiser men are.’ he said, ‘ the
more humbly will they submit to learn from others3 they do
not disdain the simplicity of those who teach them ; they are
willing to lower themselves to the level of husbandmen, of
poor women, of children. Marry things are known to the
simple and unlearned which escape the notice of the wise.

rnen of humble station, who are not named in the sch0015, than
from all the famous doctors. Let no man therefore boast of
his wisdom, or look down upon the lowly, who have knowledge
of many secret things which God has not shown to those
renowned for wisdom’ (Opus Musas, vol. i. p. 10).

Assuming that Bacon entered the Franciscan Order about
1247, he would bc at that time still in Paris. The degree of
doctor, rarely conferred before the age of thirty-five, was
probably received about the same time. He tells us (Opus
Tertium, cap. 23) that he heard William of Auvergne lecturing
to the University on the ‘ active intellect.’ This must have been
