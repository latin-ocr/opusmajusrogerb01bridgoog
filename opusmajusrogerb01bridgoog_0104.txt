CHAPTER Xll.

Many things known to the ancients we neglect, as the study of
mathematics and languages, from sheer ignorance of their value. ln
other cases the fact that subjects are not studied by the fathers is

held a good reason for passing them by. We forget that the saints
and fathers were justified by the circumstances of their time, and
moreover that they were not infallible. Augustius found much fault
with Jeronre,and soinother cases ...... 24-26

CHAPTER Xlll.

We must remember that the best Greek work was not known to
the Latin fathers. Plato indeed was translated and carefully studied;
but Aristotle, from the very fact of being Plato’s opponent, was
neglected Yet Augustino had translated the Categories, a work
highly valued by Alcuin Boethius also translated some of the
logical works But if the greater works of Aristotle had been known
to thern, they would have gladly received these, and not have troubled
themselves about the ashes of his philosophy . . · . 26-28

CHAPTER XlV.

’Πιε early Church made no use of Greek science except for the
purpose of regulating its calendar and its music. The explanation
of this neglect of ancient learning is fivefold. 1. Philosophy was the
foundation of law and governrncnt to all the nations of antiquity
except the Hebrews. 2. Therefore it was that philosophy resisted
Christianity. 3. Moreover these nations not merely studied philo·
sophy, but practised augury and oracular magio. 4. They persecuted
Christians. 5. The Church‚ finding her enemies occupied on the one
hand with the study of philosophy, and on the other with tbe study
of magio associated these two things, and thus carne to despise and
dislike philosophy. The truth is however that philosophy, so far from
being hostile to the Church, is capable of yielding it indispensable
support ............ 28-30

later ecclesiastical authorities have followed a similar course,
though without the excuse which justifies the early fathers. Though
Greek philosophy is no longer untranslated, they study only its most
