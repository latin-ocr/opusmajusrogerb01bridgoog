it was afterwards hidden from men; that Thales and his successura
down to Aristotle, aided by some traoe of primitive tradition, revived
its culture. Philosophy, therefore, has its place in the divine govern-
ment of the world: its conclusions must be demonstrated, diffused,
and enlarged. lt is a component part of that perfect wisdom which

PART lll.

THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE.

Having seen the essential unity of wisdom as contained in
Scriptura, the canon law, and philosophy, we pass to the divisions
of tlte subject. These are five. The first is the study of grammar,
not so much of Latin, as of the languages from which Latin received
its culture. 1. The quality of one language can never be perfectly
reproduced in another. This is true even of the dialects of a language:
far more true as between different languages A literal translation of
Homer into Latin, and thence into a modern language, results in utter
absurdity ........... 66-67
a. Secondly, Latin is altogether wanting in many of the necessary

3. Thirdly‚ the translator must not only be perfectly acquainted
with his subject, but also with the two languages with which he deals.
Boethius and Robert Grosseteste fulfilled these conditions. But
most translatore have failed, and especially the translators of
Aristotle. Jerome and Augustine have pointed out the errors
ol the Septuagint version and of the other versions. Nevertheless
Jerome has left very many uncorreeted ...... 67- 70
4. Fourthly, in the Latin texts now in our possession there are
vast omissions, as well as many confused and corrupt passages.

books of Samuel, Nathan, and Gad. We need also good translations
olJosephus¹s book ol Antiquities, of many of the Greek fathers, of
the secondand third books of Avicenna,and ol many essential treatises
ol Aristotle, on metaphysics, on physical and mathematical science‚
and on that part ol his logie which deals with practical reason, the
part that is of the greatest importance in the guidance of human
life ............. 70-73
5. Filthly, owing to our neglect of foreign languages, we fail to
understand the allusione to them contained in many writings of
