ray meets an opaque surface, it is turned back in a direction making

with the perpendicular to the surface an angle equal to the angle os
incidence. (d) In the case of animate bodieS, the ray follows
a tortuous path along-a nerve towards the centre of sensation. (e)
Secondary, or accidental, rays may be emitted, not from the luminous
point, but from the principal ray: as in the case of rays coming
through an opening into a dark room, from which secondary rays
are dispersed through the room; although the eye placed in one
of those rays cannot see the luminous point. Rays from the sun
of this kind are of. greater utility to living beings than direct
rays . . . .. .. . . . . . . . 460-465

Whether the ray falls on a line or on a sursace, whether the sur-
face be plane, convex or concave, the law is the same. The mode
of measuring the incident and'the reflected angle is explained else·
where. ln refraction from the rarer to the denser medium the ray
is deflected towards the normal: From the denset· to the rarer
away from the normal. The accompanying diagrams will illustrate
this. Perpendicular γεγε, coinciding with the normal, are not
deflected . . . . . . . . . . . 465-468
What is the cause of reflexion and refraction ? All media, however
transparent, offer a certain amount os resistance to the passage os the
ray. This is more completely overcome by the perpendicular than
by the oblique ray. The oblique ray, passing into the denser
medium, follows the course of the perpendicular ray as sar as
possible, i. e. is deflected' towards it, as being the path of least
resistance. On the contrary, when passing into the rarer medium,
the energy which it has been hitherto exerting in the denser, now
finds a vent in carrying it away from the normal, i.e. along a path
of greater resistance . . . . . . . . . 468--470
That these are the respective paths followed, is shown by the
double refraction taking place when rays impinge on a globular body
filled with the denser medium. The diagram shows that the rays
issuing from the globe conver-ge to a point, and that at this point
combustible substances are ignited‘ . . .. . . . 470-472

To what extent does refraction take place in the heavens? The
celestial orbs are of the same degree of translucency; in these there-
fore there is no refraction of rays. Rays passing from the sphere of
ether to that os air (which latter includes that of fire) are refracted3
since ether is the more subtle medium. The proof of this is that the
