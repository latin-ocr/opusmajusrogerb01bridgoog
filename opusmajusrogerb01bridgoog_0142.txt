The third condition is the Position os the object in respect of the
eye. They must be connected by straight lines either direct, re·
tracted or reflected. Why is this the case with vision, and not so in
the case ol hearing, or ol the sensation of beat? Aristotle here lails
us. The-difficultyis obvious Arnen cau hear his own voice: why
cannot he see his own lace? lt would seem that sound generates
something more than species ol sound: it must generate sound itsell.
The trembling ol the air following on that trembliug ol the object
struck which constitutes sound‚ is propagated in all directions, and
is therefore perceived as sound everywhere. ln the same wey an
moruus body not merely sends out species, but subtle material
particles, which being diffused through the air themselves emanate
in every direction. lt has been already explained that there are
certain qualities capable ol completing their species, by generating
lresb sources ol radiation. Fire is one oi those . . . . 56-58

The lounh condition ol vision is that tbe object be of suitable
llagnitude. Each point ol the object must be represented on the
surlace oi the lens. And although that suriam, like all others, is
infinitely divisible, yet, lor purposes ot sensation, the division must
not go so far that the points become undistinguishable. Again, the
object must not be too large What are the limitsl lf the extreme
angle ot' vision be a right angle, an eye placed at the earth's centre
would see one fourth part ol the heavens3 at the earth's surlace
something less, as geometry shows. The view that the limit ol the
angle ol vision must be a right angle rests on no souud basis, either
os theory or experiment. Examination of the structure ol the eye
lumishee geometrical prool that it is less than a right angle. And
experiment makes this certain ....... 58-61

CHAPTER 1.

The filth condition ol vision is that the Density ol the object
shall exceed that ol tbe air and ol the heavem Tbis is why we
see water, glass‚ and other transparent bodies. Air we can only see
when accumulated in great messes, which produces the same result

as density. So the most uansparent water become opaque it the
depth be very great, sbadows being cast by each particle of water
on that which succeeds to it. Further, we have to note that the
