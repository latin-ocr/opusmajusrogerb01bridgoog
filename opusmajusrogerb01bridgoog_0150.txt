presented to the earth being wholly concealed or wholly illuminated
At other times the illuminated suriace is represented by the space
lelt between the intersectione ol two great circles, the points oi
intersection being at the extremity of a lunar diameter. Regarding
these points as the lunar poles, the inner boundary ol the illuminated
part may be regarded as a meridien circle. Α circle drawn through
the lunar poles so as to divide the lunar suriace visible to us into
two equal parts may be called the lunar colure. The inner boundary
ol the luminous portion becomes identical with the colure on the
seventh and twenty-first day, 3ηά appears to us as a straight line.
Before the sourteenth day this circle presents its convert side to the
sun, aster that day its concave side. ln the latter hals ol the month
the phases are seen reversed till complete occultatiore returns.

So too by a reasoning process we become convinced that though
the heaven appears to us as a plane surlace, it must in reality be
spherical‚ or at least polyhedral, so as to be undistinguishable from
a sphere. Were it plane, the stars would all disappear below the
horizon or rise above it at the same moment . . . . 108-114

CHAPTER V.

As distance is appreciaterl only through a reasoning process, so it
is with magnitude. The mere magnitude ol the angle subtended by
the object does not suffice, lor objects ol the same magnitude at
different distances appear os different magnitude, and conversely.
As in the case os distance, there must be interrnediate objects familiar
to the eye with which mental comparison can be made Extreme
distance often renders such aeomparison impossible . . 114-116

CHAPTER Vl.

The eye looking at a sphere sees somewhat less than the half ol
it, as the third book of the Elements shows. Heavenly bodies loolr
larger at rising and setting than when at the meridiari. Why is this?
When looking either to east or west, the sky seems a plane, or nearly
plane, suriace stretched overhead. What is over the head seems
nearer to us, and subtending the same angle, is judged smaller.
further, owing to the interposition os terrestrial objects between our·
selves and the rising or setting star, we are better able to appreciate
its distance, 3ηά thus are led to imagine it larger. Our perception
ol motion and rest depende also ou a reasoning process. Motion is

apprehended by a change in the position ol a body relatively to
another, the change involving a lapse of time. Rest is the absence
ol such a change Hence illusions arise. When clouds are driven
across the moon, the moon seems to be moving through them. Τὴε
clouds must be numerous and almost continuous ior this effect to be
