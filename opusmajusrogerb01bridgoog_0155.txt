cxlvi ANALYSIS OF THE ‘OPUS MAJUS.'

which is denser than the air, towards the normal; with the exception
ol such rays as fall vertically on the cornea. The same point may
emit a vertical ray and also an infinite number of oblique mys, these
latter co·operating in the act ol vision ..... lto-148

CHAPTER ll.

The intersection ol the perpendicular directed srom a point in the
object with the visnal ray determines the apparent position ol that
point. ll the eye be in the rarer medium and the object be in the
denset the point appears nearer than it really is; and conversely 148-149

CHAPTER 111.

The case is complicated il the surface separating the two media
be not plane but spherical. Here we have eight distinct cases
l. When the cnrved refracting surlaee is concave to the eye. 1. The
eye being in the rarer medium, (a) the eye is between the centre ol
curvature and the object, (b) the centre of curvature is between the
eye and the object n. The eye being in the denser medium, cases
(a) and (b) as before. 11. When the curved refracting surlace is
convex to the eye. ι. The eye being in the rarer medium, (a) the
object may be between the centre ol curvature and the eye, (b) the
centre between the eye and the object .2. The eye being in the
denset medium, cases (a) andlb) asbelore . . . . loll-153

CHAPTER IV.

Examples ol the loregoing. The submerged part ol an oar
illustrates case 1 ol ch. 2. ll the eye were under water the upper
part would illustrate case 2. ll an object be placed in a basin, and the
observer step backwards till it becomes invisible, the object will again
become visible bypouriug water into the basin. This again illustrates
case t. The sun and moon when near the horizon, where vapours
abound, seem larger than usual The vapours form a lens with the con·
cavity towards the eye: the eye being between the centre ol curvature
and the object. The object therefore seems larger and nearer. Why
then do the sun and moon not appear larger when they are high up
and the slry is cloudy? Because in this case there is no relraction,
or but little. So there is no apparent increase ol sire when, the
horizon being free lrom wapour, there is no refraction. The angle
under which the celestial obJect is seen is ol more importance in
forming our judgement than the apparent distance, since the absence
of intervening objects makes judgementol distance difficule Acrystat
lensii consisting ol a small portion ol a sphere, with the convexity
turned to the eye, will magnify small objects placed beneath it, in
