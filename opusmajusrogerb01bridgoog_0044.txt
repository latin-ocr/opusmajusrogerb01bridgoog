POSITION AMONG SCHOOLMEN. xxxix

Terrestrial substance, said Aristotle, was made up ol matter
and sorm. Apart from iorm, what then was matter? A pure
essence, having the capacity, potentia, to become the subject os
form, was the reply. How, then, distinguish matter from this
porentia? Yet, ii thisbe so, is matter is potentially the subject
oi all possible forms, we have in matter something that under-
lies all substance. Suppose all forms destroyed, matter holding
in itsell all the conditions ol existence still remains. How,
then, distinguisb matter lrom God?

Albert's attempted solution oi the problern is involved and
obscure in the extreme, and it must not occupy us here. We
are concerned with Bacon’s. Bacon attached the problem in
his own way, and with a lull sense ol its importance. His
conclusions are expressed in the seventh chapter of tbe iourth
part of the Opus Majus, and in the thirty-eighth chapter ol
the Opus T ertium3 and a still further exposition os them is
found in the unpublished work of Bacon already mentioned,
entitled ‘Communia Naturalium! This treatise on Physical
Philosophy consists oi lour parts, oi which the discussion ol
Matter occupies the second.

Substance, Bacon maintains, can be predicated neither oi
matter noros lorm; but only ol the compound which results
from their union. ‘Compositum habet rationem per se exis·
tendi in ordine entium: non sic materia et forma? Matterand
iorm are not substances: substance results srorn their union.
Proceeding lrom above downwards through the hierarchy os
being in the order of increasing speciality, we have, as the
genus generalissimum, ‘Substantia composita universalis!
This may be corporal or spiritual. Corporal substance may
be terrestrial or celestial. Terrestrial substance may be
a mixture oi elements, or a single clement. lllixed substance
may be animate or inanimate. Animate substance may be

sensitive (ie. animal) or vegetal. Animal substance may be
rational or irrational.

To each oi these grades in the hierarchy ol substance belong
corresponding grades, not merely in the hierarchy ol iorrn, but
also in the hierarchy ol matter. ‘Matreu’ says Bacon‚ ‘is not
what most teachers oi philosophy maintain it to be, “una
