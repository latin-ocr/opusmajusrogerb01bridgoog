three years. The Pope elected in ¹27¹ (Gregory X) was
a Franciscan. Owing his elevation to St. Bonaventura‚ he

was not likely to show favour to a suspected member of his
Order. Yet it was in this year or shortly afterwards that Bacon
wrote the work known as Compendium studii Philosophiae ¹, an
introductory discourse, perhaps, l'or the encyclopaedic Srrptum
Principale, at the completion of which he was always aiming.
In this treatise Bacon plunged into stronger invective against

the intellectual 3ηά moral vices ol his time than he had ever ·

used before. In no previous writing had the moral corrup
¹ ‘tion ol the Church, from the court ol Rome downwards‚ been
so hercely stigmatized3 ‘the whole clergy is given up to pride,-
luxury, 3ηά avarice. Wherever clergymen are gathered to·
gether, as at Paris 3ηά Oxlord, their quarrels‚ their contentions,
and their vices are a scandal to laymen.’ Unbridled violence
among kings and nobles, fraud and salsehood among trades·
men 3ηά artificers were the inevitable result. Progress in
wisdom was hopeless when the moral condition ol those who
should promote it was so lar below that ol the teachers ol the
pagan world Unless sweeping remedies were applied by
a refonning Pope, there was no prospect but the advent of
Antichrist in the near future (Brewer, pp. 399-404).

Perhaps even these denunciatione roused less antagonism
than the sweeping attacks on the scholastic pedantry ol his
contemporaries, their false conceit ol wisdom, and their pre·
lerence ol metaphysical subtleties and verbal striles to the
pursuit of real knowledge. Ol these charges his previous
writings had been lull, but they were now renewed and
emphasized. Aristotelian study, which at the beginning of
the century had been the great stimulant os thought, was
already becoming the great obstruction, and was preparing
lor the next century a reign ol darkness Based on salse and
ignorant translations, it were better, Bacon said, to do away
with it altogether than that it should be carried on by men
ignorant ol the language in which Aristotle wrote, and
destitute ol the scientific training which alone could qualily
them lor explaining him (Brewer, pp. 469-473).
