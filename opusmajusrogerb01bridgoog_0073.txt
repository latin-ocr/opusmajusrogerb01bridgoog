lxiv INTRODUCTION.

obvious to be disputed. The one swayed the tides, the other
brought summer 3ηά winter. Why should the rest be sup-
posed inert? Was it· not probable that the successive and
infinitely varying connexion of each of them, singly or com·
bined. with the fixed groups of the starry vault, indicated
changes or tendencies to change here below which careful and
prolonged study might at last interpret?

So it was that with the growth os knowledge, and with
increasing strength of the conviction that all nature was under
the dominion of fixed laws, astrology came to be regarded as
the key to the understanding of all that was speciallycon·
tingent and variable in man's environment; the phenomena
os temperament and of disease3 the revolutione os states, and
even oi religione. The boundary os its lawlul application was
drawn differently by different thinkers. Apart from charlatans
and miracle-mongers‚ sew stretched it farther than Bacon.
But by him, as strictly as by Aquinas, the saving clause, ‘salva
arbitrii libertate‚’ was always added. Outside influences
might suggest motive and kindle passion3 they could never
trench upon the sacred domain ol the freedom ol the will ¹.

What is strange is not that the belief in the convergence oi

that in order to appretiare astrology with any approach to justice, it is needlul
to keep steadily in view the very real connexion between the sciences ol
astronomy and biology. On the relations os mass andos distance between
theson and earth, involving as they do the familiar facts oi weight, equilibrium
oi lluids, temperature, lise on our planet is obviously dependent. ls we consider
the period and velocity os the esrth's rotatim, the degree os ellipticity os her
orbit‚ the angle at which the axis ol rotation is inclined to the plane ol the orbit,
the same truth is impressed upon us even more strongly. ‘In the early stages
ol the human mind these connecting links between astronomy and biology were
studied srorn a very different point os view ; but at least they were studied and not
lest out ol sight, as is the common tendency in our own time under the restricting
intluence oia nascent and incomplete positivism. Beneath the chimerical beliess
of the old philosophy inthe physiological inssuence os the stars, there lays strong
though confused recognition ol the truth that the facts os lile were in some way
dependent on the solar system. Like all primitive inspirations ol man's inlelli-
gence this feeling needed rectification by positive science, but not destruction ;
though unhappily in science, as in politica, it is ollen hard to reorganize without
some brief period oi overthrow.’ This was written in 1836. Much has been
donc since by ΜΓ. Spencer and others to familiarize the European mind with

the dependence ol lile on its astronomical conditions. But the injustice in our
historical judgement os mediaeval astrology still remeius.
