1. BACON'S LIFE.

IN considering the little that is known ol the life ol Bacon,
it is well to give precedence to the lew facts that are fixed
with perfect precision by his own statement. We know with
entire accuracy the date ol the composition ol the Opus
Majus, and of the two subsidiary works, the Opus Minus and
the Opus T artium. Pope Clement¹ lv·s instructions to him
to transmit the results os his labours were issued June 22,
1266 from viterbo. Within the year that followed, the Opus
Mases, with its supplement, the Opus Minus, and its intro-
duction‚ the Opus Tertium, had been completed and sent to
the Pope. At this time he speaks ol himsell as an old man,
and he says that he had been studying language, science,
and philosophy lor nearly lorty years (Opus Tertium, cap. 20).
From this it may be supposed that he was born between 1210
and 1215. But the place ol' his birth cannot be said to be
fixed with certainty.

One, and only on'e, notice os his name occurs in a con·

'Guy Fulcodi (or Foulques), who succeeded to the Papacy iu 12⁶5 as ,

Clement lV, was born at Saint Gilles in languedoc. lle began his career by
studying law, in which be achieved great distinction. He was married and had
several children. He seems to have acted lor some time as a private secretary
to Louis lx. atter his wile’s death he entered the Church, was made uch-
bishop os Narbonne in 1259, and cardinal bishop ol S. Sabina in ωσι. (See
Fleury, Hr'st. Ercle'srirsh'que, liv. 85, whose spelling ol the neme Guy fulcodi is
here adopted.) Brewer conjectures (pp. xi et seq.) that he entered into

, relations with Baton on the occasion ol his mission to Englnnd as Papsl legate

in 12⁶3 or 1264. But Bacon was then in Paris, and had been there lor several
years. Guy Fulcodi had sar better opportunities ot hearing about Baeon in Paris
than could have occurred during the time ol his stormy and ineffectual legation

to England.
