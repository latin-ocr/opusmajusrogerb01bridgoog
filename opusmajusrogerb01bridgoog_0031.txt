xxvi INTRODUCTION.

kinds3 he knows everything relating to the art ol war, the
making of weapons, and the chase 3 he has looked closely into
agriculture, mensuration, and larming work 3 he has even taken
note ol the remedies, lot-casting‚ and charms used by old
women and by wizards and magicians, and ol the deceptions
and devices ol conjurors‚ so that nothing which deserves
inquiry should escape him, and that he may be able to expose
the ialsehoods ol magicians. ll philosophy is to be carried
to its perlection and is to be handled with utility and certainty,
his aid is indispensable. As sor reward, he neither receives
nor seeks it. If he frequented ln'ngs and princeS, he would
easily find those who would bestow on him honours and wealth.
Or, il in Paris he would display the results of his researches,
the whole world would follow him. But since either ol these
courses would hinder him from pursuing the great experiments
in which he delights, he puts honour and wealth aside, knowing

productiori of a mirror that shall produce combustion at a fixed
distance; a problem which the Latios have neither solved nor

Oi this remarkable man little is known but what Bacon
tells us in the soregoing and other passages ol the Opus
Tertium, and the Opus Majus. But what we know is not
inconsistent with Bacon’s eulogy. Libri, in a note contained
in the second volume ol his Historyof Mathematics, transcribes
a letter written by Peter Peregrinus ol Maricourt to a certain
Sigermus of Fontancourt‚ which is a treatise on the properties
ol the magic stone. on the relations os its poles to those ol
the heavens and earth, on the way to fmd these poles; on the
repulsion in two magnets of poles ol the same name, and the
attraction os those ot different names 3 and on the construction
ol a globe which should revolve with the revolution ol' the
heavenS, and thus supply the place ol the ordinary observation
by the astrolabe. This is, no doubt, the invention os which

Bacon speaks in the sixth part oi the Opus lllajus. Gilbert,
in his great work on Magnetism, makes frequent mention ol'
this treatise ol Peter Peregrinus; and a carelul comparison
