horribilis difficultas, maxime in libris Aristotelis translatis ¹,

aduersantibus,' is Matthew Paris' description oi him. Visiting Pope innocent
IV in 1250 to protest against the ahuses oi the Hospitallers and Templars, and
finding that his opponents had deasened the papal ear with hribes, ‘O gold, gold)
he eried, ‘how great is thy power, especially in the Court ol Rome l' ln the
last year ul his tite, he wrote to the Pope, plainly telling him that his vow oi
obedience to the Church sorbade compliance with his extortionate demands lor
money. ‘Tilialiter et obedienter non obedio, contradico et rebello.’ The Pope
could not contain himself lor anger. ‘Who is this mad old man‚' he cried, ‘who
dares to sit in judgement on our aetionst’ But Cardinal Aegidius and others re·
strained his wrath. ‘It' we are to tell the truth.’ they said, ‘the things he writes
are true. He isa Catholic man ot¹ most holy lise, more religious and more
excellent than we. He is held t‘or a great philosopher, deeply learned in latin
and Greek literature, zeelous lor justice, a teacher in theological schools‚
a preacher to the people, a lover oi chastity, an uprooter os simony! (Matthew
Paris, ad ann. 1253.)

lt would seem probable that his scientific wurks were written before his
elevation to the hishopric. Among them are, Libellus de physicas lr'trels angulis
et figuras per quas omues actiones naturales compleatur: a treatise Donatum
locomm; and a treatise De artatus liberalibus. These were printed in Venice,
¹514· Among the Harleian MSS. are two, as yet unedited: 7402, a treatise
on the calendar: and 4350, on the Celestial Sphere. Os Greek. according
to Bacou, his knowledge was hut slight; hut he introduced several Greek
scholars into England, one oi whom, Nicolas, translated the apocryphal
Testaments ol the twelve patriarcha brought from Athens hy John os Basing·
stoke. (Cf. Matthew Paris, ad ann. 1252). lt seems probable that bacon in
the early part oi his career prolited much t'rom Grosstete's teaching. The
language ol the Lubellus de phycuus lines, as to the propagation ol soree, and
as to the laws oi rellection and refraction, hears a remarkable resemblance to
that oi Bacou.

² Cantor, in his Hr’story duellum, speaking ol the school ol translation
set up at Toledo in the twellth century under the direction ol Raymuud, the
archhishop oi that city, by Dominic Gundisalvi and John ol Seville, remarks ε
‘Their labours were conducted in a circuitous lashion which had its conse·
quences. The Arahic was first translated into Castilian, and irum this the
Latin version was made. Bearing in mind that the Arahic text was taken from
the Greek hy men whose powers ol translation were not wholly beyond
suspicion, we may imagine what sort ol Aristotelian philosophy reached the
mediaeval student alter three repetitions oi hungling.' Cantor, vol. i. p. 684.
J ourdain, in his work Roelrerclus ningues sur l'dge et l'ongr'ne des traductione
latinas d’An'stote rNouvelle edition, 1843), has supplied specimens ol these
translations which enable us to t'orm some judgement os their value3 since he
distinguishes those made directly from the Greek text lrom those made l'rom
Arahic versinus. The latter are not so inferior to the former as might have
been expected3 probably because the Arah scholam οἱ the tenth and eleventh
centuries knew more Greek than the European scholam ol the tweltth and
