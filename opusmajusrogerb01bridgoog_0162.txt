ln this we leave altogether the domain of the sciences now re·
cognized, and open out entirely new departments of research. At
present the influences exerted on us hythe stars can only be known
through drflicult astronomical calculatione Experimental science
may enable us to estimate thern directly. lt may be possible for us
to act on the character of the inhabitants of any region by altering
¹ their environment. Inventions of the greatest utility may be dis-
covered, as perpetual fite, or explosive substances, or modes of
counteracting dangerous poisons, and innumerable other properties
of matter as yet unknown for want of experiment. Τὴε Magnet, of
which use is already made, is but a type of other mutual attractions
exerted by bodies at a distance. For instance, if a young sapling be
longitudinallydivided and the two divisions be brought near together,
held euch by the middle, the extremities will bend towards each other.
ln conclusion, Ι may point out the influence which the possessors
of this science may exercise in the promotion of Christianity among
the heathen, whether in subduing their pride, in disabusing thern
of false beliefs in magic, or in overcoming their material force . 215-222

We have now considered Philology, Mathematics, and Experi-
mental Science, and have seen their intrinsic importance, and their
velue to the Church. l corne now to a fourth science, which stands
on a higher level ς that which relates to the practical conduct of life.
Other sciences relate to action of various kinds; but this to those
actions by which we become good or bad. lt is the seleuce which
instructs Man as to his relations to God, and to his neighbour and to
himself. lt deals therefore with the final purpose of all human
wisdom. lt is closely related to Theology‚ to which it supplies
important aid, sharing therefore its dignity. Proceeding to the
divisions of the subject, the first point to note is that the conclusions
of the previous sciences form the principles of ethical science. The
others have prepared the way for this seleuce as their mistress. We
lind ethical principles everywhere diffused through them, which are
now by this highest of the sciences to be gathered together and find
