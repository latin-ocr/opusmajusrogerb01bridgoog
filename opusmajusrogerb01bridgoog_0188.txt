apparent polnr distance of a star is less when rising than when passing
the meridien. At the zenith, the ray, impinging on the sphere oi air
perpendicularly, is unreiracted. At the horizon it is refracted. With
the circumpolar stars the polar distance appears less, when they pass
the meridien nearer the horizon, than when they pass it nearer the
zenith3 for the same reason. The precise quantity ω’ this refraction
canbemeasuredbyastronomical instruments Ptolemy first indicated
this source oi error, and Alharen has verified it. lt has to be taken
account ofin lunar tables ........ 472-476
There is no subsequent refraction between the sphere os tire and 2
that of air, as the one passes into the other by imperceptible
degrees ........... tto-477
Rays falling from the planeta on regions oi the earth beyond the
tropics must all iall obliquely and thereforeberesracted . . 477478

CHAPTER V.

(a) No bodies are so dense that rays may not pass through them,
though these may not always be perceptihle by human organs. Some
bodies os intermediate density may partly retract, and partly reticet
the rays, as in the case ol water .. . . . . . 478-479

(h) Hardness and. solidity are to be distinguished from density.
Glass and crystal‚ though hard, must yet be rare, i..e. their particles
must lie somewhat sar apart, since rays pass ireely through thern.
Hardness dependo not on the number nithe particles but on stability
and freedom from moisture (c) Rellexion depends on the smooth-

’ ness oi the suriaco that reflecte, A rough sursace disperses the rays
in different directions .......... 479

(d) We must not suppose that the ray produces any effect on the
suriace that reflects it. N o secondary or accidental ray is generated at
the point of reflexion. Were it so, such an effect would be visible‚
whatever our position might he with regard to the mirror. All that
the reflecting suriace does is to change the direction oi the ray.
The reflected rayis strictly continnous with the incident ray . 479-481

CHAPTER Vl.

ln reflexion, the angles made by the incident and the reflected ray
with the perpendicular to the surlace are equal. This may be shown
experimentally hyan instrument constructed ior the purpose, and
the diagrams annexed give geometrical proof ot' it. The rule holds,
whether the reflecting suriace be plane, concam, or conver . 481486

CHAPTER Vll.

Rays reflected irum a plain surlace are divergent. Rays reflected
irom a spherical concave suriace converge at various points on
