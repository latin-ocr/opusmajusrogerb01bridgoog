problem, and had seen its bearing and importance as a uni-
versal method oi research. ·1mplicitly men ol science had
begun to recognize the value os experiment. What Bacon
did wasto make the recognition explicit. ‚Experiment took
its placeas a distinct department ol philosophy.

What makes this result peculiarly remarkable is that it was
reached by a thinker who was so proloundly penetrated by
the mathematical spirit. In this matter Roger Bacon compares
favourably with his illustrious namesake oi the seventeenth

. century, who wholly failed to appreciate the import of mathe-
matical method. He rises to the level ol one greater than
either—the author ol the Discours sur la Mlthode. For
Descartes as sor Roger Bacon, mathematics was clavis
scientiarum, the key to the temple ol science. But it was
held by both alike that experiment was needed to carry out
the researches which mathematical deduction had suggested ;
and that, as each science greW, the share taken by experiment
in its progress was to become more and more predominant

Last in order, both in the Opus Majus and in the Scriptum
Principak, comes the science the study ol which is the key·
stone and crown of the whole work-the science os lile and
conduct. All the other sciences lead up to this Their con·

The analysis which has been given ol this, as ol other parts
ol the work, renders it unnecessary to cover the ground a
second time. But a lew remarks may be made on its salient
features In thefirst book, which treats of man's relation to God,
Bacon follows the procedure common to Aquinas,indeed to most
ol the schoolmen‚ ol pushing metaphysical reasoning as lar as
it carr be made to go in support ol the articles os the Catholic
saith. Theology‚ says Aquinas (S. T. Pars Ι. Quaest. i. art. 5),
uses other sciences as her handmaids and assistants. Man is
more easily led on to things above reason, il he begins with
things which reason can demonstrate. It is true that unassisted
reason is incompetent to discover and demonstrate the doctrine
