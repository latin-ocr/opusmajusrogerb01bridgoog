the transmutation of metals, the discovery of the philosophers
egg, or the elixir vitae. But Bacon was one of the few who
saw that the empirica] proceedings of the honest mystics or
scheming charlatans, who were toiling at their royal road to
wealth or longevity, covered speculations of a far deeper kind;
the study of the transition of matter from the four Aristo
telian elements‚ through increasing degrees of complexity, up
to the highly compound forms exhibited by organized bodies.
The ‘Alkimia Speculativa’ of Bacon was, indeed, not alchemy
at all as commonly understood: it was nothing less than
chemistry. ‘Alkimia speculativa, he says, in the twelfth
chapter of the Opus Tertium, ‘treats of the generation of things
from their elements and of all inanimate things-as of the
elements and liquids (humores) simple and compound; common
stoneS, gems‚ and marbles; gold, and other metals3 sulphur,
salts, pigments, lapis lazuli, minium, and other colours; oils,
bitumen, and very many other things-of which we find nothing
in the books of Aristotle; nor are the natural philosophers or
any of the Latins acquainted with these things. And being
ignorant of them. they can know nothing of what follows in
physics, that is, of the generation of animate things—as
vegetables, animala and man—because knowing not what is
prior, they must remain ignorant of what is posterior. For
the generation of men, and of brutes, and of plants, is from
elemental and liquid substances‚ and is of like manner with the
generation of inanimate things. Wherefore, through ignorance
of this science, neither can natural philosophy, commonly so-
called, be known, nor the theory, and therefore neither the
practice, of medicine; not merely because natural philosophy
and theoretical medicine are necessary for the practice, but
because all simple medicines are derived from inanimate
things by this science.'

Of such fundamental truths of chemical science-as the
composition of air and water, the theory of combustion, and
the chemistry of carbon-he, like his contemporaries, was
ignorant, but the ignorance was shared by the second Bacon
with the first, and was not to be dissipated for five centuries.

'All that could be done iu the meanwhile was to collect empi-
