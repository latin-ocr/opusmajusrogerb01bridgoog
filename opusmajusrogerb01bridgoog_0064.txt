paralyzing her energies. Five generations were to pass before
she could again begin to promote the study ol ‘languages
other than Latin¹’; and even then not in the comprehensive
spirit which Bacon had advocated. lt is tempting, though
painiul and perhaps useless, to imagine how iar European
culture might have advanced had schools ol Orientai languages,
concurrently with those ol Greek and Latin, been instituted
and continuously maintained irom the thirteenth century.

V. Bacou’s Maruuuamcs.

ln the Opus Majm, though much is said ot' the importance
and necessity of mathematical method‚ there is very little
display ol mathematical knowledge. Frequent references are
made to Euclid‚ whose Elements had been introduced to the
western world early in the previous century, by Adelard oi
Bath, and more completely in the thirteenth century by Cam-
panus of Novara. Archimedes and Apollonius are rarely
mentioned. But in his Optics Bacon shows that he was
acquainted with the properties oi parabolic concave mirrors.
and os their power of causing parallel rays to converge aster
reflection to a iocus. ln this respect he was in advance ol his
principal teachers in Optic, Euclid‚ Ptolemy, and Alhazen.

Os the Calculus arithmetical or algebraical‚ Bacon has but
slight occasion to speak in the Opus Majus. It has always
to be remembered that this work, with its appendices, the
Opus Minus and Opus Tertium, was not, properly speaking,
a philosophical treatise‚ but an exhortation addressed to a
statesman, absorbed in ecclesiastical and political struggles‚
to exert his authority lor the revival oi learning. Hence it
is uniformly spoken os as a Persuastb. It contains justas
much learning and science as was thought neediul to convince
the Pope that learning and science were capable oi strengthen-
ing the Church. It is but the preamble to the ‘Scriptum

¹ The organized teaching oi Greek in Oxiord is due to Richard forre, the
founder oreorpus Christi College (1515-162· But when Erasmus was in Oxiord

about twenty years earlier, such men as Thomas Linacre and william Grocyn
had already become Greek scholars, under the reaching, perhaps, oi Cornelio
Vitelli. (Cl. flauam, Lr't. Hiar. os Europe, port i. ch. 3.)
