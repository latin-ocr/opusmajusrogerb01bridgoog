ASTROLOGY. lix

Here the portion of the work contained in the Sloane MSS.
ends We find it continued, however, in a somewhat frag·
mentary way in the Bodleian Digby MSS. No. 76. The
author proceeds to the consideration of geometrical truths,
professing his intention to select those which were ol para·
mount importance, since it was obvious that the number of
possible problems in geometry was infinite

‘lllae (veritates),’ he says, ‘sunt eligendae quae possunt
vocari radices et elementa respectu ramorum et foliorum,
quorum fructus vadit in infinitum! Proof is given in this
part of the work that Bacon was acquainted with the geometry
of Apollonius as well as with that of Euclid. After defining
the cone (‘ pyramis rotunda ’) he mentions its three sections,
presenting curves of a different form from the circle, one of
which was of use in the construction of mirrors capable of
'rendering rays convergent to a point. He promises to deal
with these curves later in the work.

Of the whole, so far as the fragment of his mathematical
work preserved to us enables us to judge, it would seem that
Bacon had made himself acquainted with the highest mathe-
matics of his time; though no evidence is forthcoming to show
that he contributed personally to the advance of the seleuce,
otherwise than by strongly insisting on its culture, and by
pointing out new fields for its practical application, in the
better government of the Church, and in the development of
industry. His interest, like that of Galileo, lay in applied
rather than in abstract mathematics. Whether the study of ·
equations as carried on by the Italian algebraists of the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries would have interested
him is doubtful. But he would have eagerly welcomed the
invention of logaritth, as facilitating the construction of

astronomical tables.

The transition from Mathematics to Physics supplies the
best opportunity for a few remarks on the subject of Bacon's
Astrology, on which something is also said in a note to vol. i.
