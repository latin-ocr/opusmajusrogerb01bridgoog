THE OPUS MAJUS. lxxxix

wisdom’ (Op. T crt. ch. 4). Much light is thrown by passages
like these, and there are many such, on the varied and at first
sight heterogeneous character os the Opus Majus. A glauce

at the Index oi this edition will give some notion ol the
multiplicity oi the topics treated. History ol philosophy,
comparative philology, mathematics‚ astronomy, geography,
optics‚ the physiology os sensation, all find a place3 and all
are subordinated to the service oi the Catholic Church as the
guardian ol the highest interests oi man. Au these topics
are handled so sar and in such a way as to convince the Pope‚
or others in authority, oi the width ol the field to be culti-
vated, and ol the importance ol the object in view. Bacon's
procedure is like that ol a traveller in a new world, who brings
back specimens oi its produce, with the view oi persuading the
authorities of his country to undertake a more systematic
exploration. To that further and more complete inquiry he
proposed to devote the remainder os his lise. He speaks oi
it in several passages oi the present work under the title
oi Scriptum Principale. But, as we have reason to believe,
oi the twenty-five years oi lile that remained, more than hall
were sterilized by his imprisonment. When released‚ though
he persevered‚ like Galileo, indomitably to the end, he was
too old to think with his former vigour, and was capable only
ol' such inferior work as the Campcndium Τ heongme, or the
Commentary on the Secretum Secretorum. There remain
the years between 1268 and 1278. They produced the Com-
pendium Stadii (published by Brewer)‚ the Communia Natu·
ratium, the Communia Mathematicac, and other fragments
oi the Scriptum Principale. But, making large allowance ior
what may have been lost through neglect or through malig-
nant hostility, or ior what may yet remain to be discovered,
the balance oi probabilities indicates clearly enough that the
Scriptum Principale was never brought to completion. The
Opus Majus remains the one work in which the central
thought of Bacon is dominant lrorn first to last; the unity
oi science, and its subordination to the highest ethical pur-
pose conceivable by man.

Another characteristic oi Bacon's philosophy, to which it
