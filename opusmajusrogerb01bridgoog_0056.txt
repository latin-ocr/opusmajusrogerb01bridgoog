SCRIPTUM PRINCIPALE. xlvii

Our aim being to understand the conditions of his health or
disease‚ we have first to examine his structure and develop-
ment, without which health and disease cannot be understood
or spoken of.

F inally, to complete the whole, comes Experimental science.
It is, he sayS, a final judge of the assertions and reasonings put
forth in all the foregoing scienceS. More than this: it gives
directions to those engaged in other sciences as to the construc-
tion of instruments by which their conclusions are to be tested,
in the same way in which a navigator instructs a shipwright as
to the building os a ship. Thus, for instance, it instructs the
geometer to make a mirror such that the rays reflected from
it shall converge in a single point. It scrutinizes every natural,
every artificial force. It sists the artifices os magic, as logie
sifts the reasonings of the sophist, so as to dissipate salsehood
and error, and leave nothing but truth remaining.

How Bacon would have treated this part of the subject we
have no means os judging, other than the sixth section of the
Opus Majm. But even the summary exposition there given is
enough to show how large was his conception os experimental
method, and at the same time how caresully he steered clear
os the danger of undervaluing the mathematical or deductive
process os discovery. So sar as was possible the two should
be pursued simultaneously and in close alliance. Euclid's
demonstration os his first proposition would, he sayS, fail to
carry complete conviction unless visual evidence os it were
forthcoming in the construction of the figure. And on the
other hand, we see that his inductive investigations os the
rainbow were controlled at every step by deductions from
astronomy.

With these general remarks, we may now pass to each os
the principal divisions os the ‘ Scriptum Principale,' which in
the main correspond to the order followed in the Opus Majus.

Ψ · First comes Language, as the channel through which the
thoughts of other men are handed down to us; then follows
Mathematic, embracing the four branches os the Quadrivium,
geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, and music. Thence we
pass to physic, which included the study of the propagation
