cviii ANALYSIS OF THE ‘OPUS rmus?

CHAPTER Xl.
vot„ 1. alors

Suppose two vessels similar in shape and equal insite 3 one placed
at a higher level than the other. More vater can be placed in the
lower, sor its suriace will be a portion ol a smaller sphere: the
diameter ol the rim ol the vessel being equal in both cases . 157-159

CHAPTER Xll.

The Platonic school maintained that heaven and the four elements
corresponded to the live regular solids. For there can he no more
than five. Since in the dodekahedron the other sourcan be inscribed,
this was regarded as representing heaven: lire was identified with
the tetrahedron, air with the octahedron, earth with the cuhe, water
with the icosihedron. But the difficulty in this theory is that,
though solid masses can he built up ol tetrahedra and os cub'es with·
out leaving vacua, this is not the case with the other three . 159—164

CHAPTER Xlll.

There ean he only one universe F or, on the supposition that
there were two, both being spherical would touch in one point only,
so that a vacuum would be left, which is impossible. Further, the
universe cannot he infinite, otherwise two infinite lines, lrom one oi

which a given portion was cut off, would be equal 3 i. e. the part
would beequal tothe whole, which is impossible . . . lot-165

CHAPTER xlv,

Unity ol time does not imply unity ol matter. N or is it needt'ul to
suppose plurality os ages (aeva). The,subject of time is not matter,
but motion. The subject ol motion is not matter, but body composed
os matter and form. Motion is oi linear dimension. Prior excludes
posterior, past excludes future. But as to the present being a point
having no dimension, there is no such exclusion: one point does not
exclude another: many points occupy the position of one. One
present moment suffices lor all present momente Hence time isone.

And so to the conception ol aevum the same applies. lt is single and
not multiple .......... 165-167

CHAPTER XV.

ln a body falling to the earth’s centre, a strain is involved: since,
though the central point ol the body tends directly towards the
oentre, the extreme points are preveuted from doing so. From this
strain heat results This is shown by experiment to be the lact. But
on geometrical grounds the reason oi this lact appears: and our
knowledge ofit becomes thus more complete . . . . lot-169
