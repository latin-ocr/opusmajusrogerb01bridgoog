PROPAGATJON oF FORCE. lxvii

out of the matter acted on. ‘ Fit species de potentia activa
materiae patientis.’ The agent acts on the first part of the
body of the patient, and stimulates its latent energy to the
generation os the species, That part thus transmuted acts on
the part next succeeding 3 and so the action proceeds (De Mult.
. spec. p· 457)-

While the agent acts on the patient, the patient re-acts on
the agent. ‘ Omne agens physice patitur et transmutatur
insimul dum agit, et omne patiens physice agit' (De Mult.
Spec. p. 439). Heavenly bodies as they act on one another, so
do they receive emanations of force from terrestrial bodies,
Not that they are so affected by them as to be destroyed,
being incorruptible. Nevertheless there is in this way an
interchange of force between all parts of the universe (p. 448).

The ray, or species, is of corporeal nature ; but this corporeal
nature is not distinct from that of the medium ; it is generated
from the substance of the medium, and is continually re-formed
out of successive portions of the medium occurring in the line
along which the force is propagated (p. 505). 1f wind is
driving the air transversely to the line of force, this in no way
affects this line. The species is formed and reformed from
particles of the medium presented in the line of propagation‚
and from no others,

Finally the propagation of rays occupies time (vol. ii. pp.
67-72 and 52 5-9)‚ though its velocity is such that the time
occupied in passing through so vast a space as the diameter
os the universe is imperceptible to sense.

It will be seen from the foregoing how wide is the divergence
between Democritean and Baconian physics. Though Bacon
retains the word ‘ species ’ in his theory, the word has almost
entirely lost the significance attached to it by Lucretius,
We are no longer dealing with the notion that bodies emit
from their surface films or moulds which are transmitted
through space. Like the word ‘ ray,' which is retained by the
modern physicist who accepts the undulatory theory, ‘ species '
sor Bacon has become a mere word to denote the propagation
of force in certain definite directions. 1 ndeed the multiplica-
tion of species as defined by him has much in common with
