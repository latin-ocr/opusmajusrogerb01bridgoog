clxx ANALYSIS OF THE ‘OPUS MAJth,'

von. tt. raons
Avicenna and Albumazar to be imperfect and transitory. We may
add to this the testimony of the Sibyls. Coming more into detail, we
find the Jewish prophets bearing testimony for Christ, and Josephus
supplying proof that Judaism would give way to Christianity. Other
evidence is contained in the books of Esdras and of the twelve
Patriarchs. The authorship of these books is unknown, but they
are of weighty authority. Further, the Jewish religion taken by itself,
with its incessant slaughtering of cattle, is extremely repulsive3 andis
so spoken of in the Psalms and prophetical books. Similarly the
Koran uses very strong language in praise of Christ. Mahommedan
writers say much in dispraise of their-own sect, and admit that the
life of its founder was stained by many vices. Accepting then the
testimony of each sect as standing on the same level, we find none of
them, except the Christian, testifying in favour of their own founder,

to whom both Jewish and Mahommedan authorities, as well as
Christian, bear witness ........ 388-393

The credibility of Christian writers rests on six grounds: personal
sanctity; wisdom; miraculous powers 3 firmness under persecution3
uniformity of faith; their victory in spite of humble origin and estate.
Besides these grounds for accepting Christianity, there are the
miracles wrought by Jesus, especially the forgiveness of sins, the
surest proof of His Divine nature. For neither Moses nor for
Mahomet was divinity claimed. There is the yet further proof of
holiness of life, which both in Mahommedanism and Judaism is
found wanting. ln neither is there any recommendation of poverty,
chastity, and obedience. N or is the sanction of afuture life clearly
set forth in them ......... 393-396

llaving thus proved that the Christian saith is to be accepted as
true, we need not examine each one of its articles. There is however
one of them as to which much difficulty bas been experienced, the
Sacrament of the Altar. 1 wish therefore to give reasons why it
should be willingly aud ardently accepted, containing as it does the
essence of the whole. First‚ it is accepted by the whole Christian
Church. Secondly, it is manifestly set forth in Scriptum, as in the
Gospel of St. John, and in the Book of Wisdom‚ and in the Epistle of
St. Peter. Thirdly, it is confirmed by the unanimous authority of the
saints. F ourthly, we may add the testimony of innumerable miracles,
ol which l here record two of undoubted authenticity and recent date.
Finally, as the Creator is omnipresent throughout the world, so by
this sacrament is the Redeemer omnipresent to those who are in
astate of grace. Without the Creator's presence the creature would

cease to exist. So without the Re-creator's presenoe would the
re·created fall from the state of grace. lt consiste with the infinite
power and goodness of Christ that this infinite good should be
