stitutes a test to which all the conclusions ol other sciences are to be
subjected. ln other sciences the principles are discovered by experi-
ment‚ but the conclusion by reasoning. An instance of this is
afforded by the rainb0W‚ and by other phenomena of a similar kind,
as haloes, &a The natural philosopher lorms a J'udgement on
these things: the experimenter proceeds to test the judgemenu
He seeks lor visible objects in which the colours ol the rainbow
appear in the same order. He finds this the osse with lrish
hexagonal crystals when held in the sun's rays. This property, he
discovers, is not peculiar to these crystals, but is common to all
transparent substances ol similar shape, similarly placed. He finds
these colours again on the surlace of crystals when slightly roughcned.
He finds them in the drops that sall from the rower's oar, when the
sun’s rays strike them, or from a water-wheel, or in the morning-den
on the grass. They may be seen again in sunshine when the eye is
hall opened‚ and in many other cases ..... tta-174

The shape in which the colours are disposed will vary. Sometimes
it is rectangular, sometimes circular ....... 174

Armed with these terrestrial laets, the experimenter proceeds to
examine the celestial phenomenon. He finds, on examining the sun’s
altitude and that ol the summit ol the bow, that the two vary inversely.
The bow is always opposite the sun. Α line may be drawn lrom the
centre os the sun through the eye ol the observer and the centre ol
the circle ol which the bow is an arc to the sun's nadir. As one

extremity ol this line is depressed, the other is elevated. lt becomes
thus possible to compute the altitude ol the sun beyond which no

rainbow is possible, and also the maximum altitude ol the bow. lt
will be found both by calculation and experience that this altitude in
the latitude oi Paris is lorty-two degrees ..... 175-178

CHAPTER V.

Still further investigating the shape oi the in's, and the portion oi it
that can be seen, the experimenterconceives a cone oi which the apex
is the eye, the base is the circle ol the iris, the axis being the line '
already described drawn from the sun’s centre through the eye to the
sun's nadir. ln cases where this cone is very short, the whole of
the base may be above the horizon, as may osten be seen in the spray
ol a waterlall. ln the sky however the cone is too elongated to adrnit
ol this: the base is bisected in various proportions by the planeol the
