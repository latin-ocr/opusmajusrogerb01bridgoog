' lii INTRODUCTION..

After the time of Jcrome, the translation from thc'Septuagint

continued to be used in the Psalter3 but, with that exception, .

Jerome's translation from the Hebrew constituted the Vulgate,
and was received as authentic by the Church. Bacon is care·
ful to add that lerome's version is by no means free from
error, due partly to over-haste, partly to his unwillingness to
offend his contemporaries by- making too many changes in
the text hitherto accepted.

With Aristotle the case was even worse than with the
Bible. The brilliant hopes with which the century had
opened‚ of re-entering the temple of Greek wisdom, and

Bacon calls attention, werc five: Gerard of Cremona, Alured
or Alfred of England, Michael Scot, Hermann the German,
William of Moerbeke, otherwise called the Fleming. Of
these, Gerard‚ Scot, and Hermann translated from Arabio
versions. Gerard spent many years in Spain, attained a
thorough knowledge of Arabic, and translated Ptolemy's
Almagest, and Aristotle's Meteorologics, also the astronomy
of Alfraganus‚ several works of Alkindi, and, almost certainly,
the Optics of Alhazen. He died in 1187. Michael Scot
flourished in the first half of the thirteenth century. He
was a friend of the Emperor Frederic ll, under whose
