MORAL PHILOSOPH Υ. lxxxv

Aristode, Plato, Cicero, and above all, from Seneca, adding
the fewest words os his own that were needed to mould them
into systematic shape.

He begins by adopting Aristotle’s general scheme ol the
moral virtues as means between opposing vices. From these
he passes to the consideration os special vices in the order
of the seven mortal sins of Catholic theology. “ Six of these
deal with man's conduct under prosperous circumstances3
the seventh, anger, with his conduct in adversity. Dealing
brielly with the first class, Bacon devotes much more atten-
tion to the subject of anger. His reason sor doing so lay in
the disturbing influences ol this passion on the whole os man's
lile public and private, and also that, in secking remedies sor
its ravages, we are led up to the state ol inward peace and
resignation under outward trials which forms the highest plane
to which the soul can aspire.

N early the whole os Seneca's three dialogues on Anger are
quoted, but with complete rearrangement, in pursuance os the
aim in view. Beginning with a picture os this passion and its
disastrous eflects on the highest qualities of the soul, such as
clemency, pity, and joy, he enlarges on examples os sels-
restraint, and thence proceeds to consider remedial acti0n3
patient inquiry‚ time allowed sor the mood to pass by,
and constant remembrance of human fellowship with the
offender.

This leads him to the wider subject ol fortitude under
oelamity, of forgiveness oi injury and insult‚ ol recognition of
the truth that whom God loves He chastens. He concludes
the section with long selections from the dialogues on consola-
tion under bereavement, exile, and poverty, on the shortness
oi life and the state os inward bliss and spiritual peace. lt
appears that though other parts ol Seneca were well known,
especially the series os letters to Lucilius, these dialogues had

escaped notice till Bacon called attention to them. The
apocryphal correspondence between Seneca and St. Paul
shows that an affinity between Seneca and Christian teaching
had been widely recognized in the Church. Nowhere is this
affinity so strongly marked as in the dialogues De Providentia,
