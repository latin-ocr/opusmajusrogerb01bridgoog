The vitreous is denser than the crystalline, so that refraction os
the entering ray takes place towards the normal Through it visual
impressions are continued to the expanded fibres os the optic nerve.
This nerve is the direct channel ol communication with the brain.
The consolidativa (sclerotic) is moist so as to adapt itselt' to the
inward structures; firm, so as to keep them in their plaoes; and
white, so as to contribute to the beauty os the sace . . . 2849

The eyelids protect the eyes during sleep, and from invasion ot
irritating particles; thus the eyes have rest from the toil os receiving
impressione. The lashes moderate the intensity of impressions.
Creative goodness has supplied two eyes, in case of accident to one3
and to add beauty to the iane. The eyes are spherical, so as to
admit oi easy and swill motion in all directions3 and also, because
had their surlace been plane, rays from the points oi a large object
would not havebeen normal to the suriace. As it is, perpendicular
rays impinge upon their suriace from nearly a fourth part os the
horizon at once .......... aaut

CHAPTER Ι.

We have now explained the instruments of vision. We pass to the
iunction itseli ; considering in the first place rectilineus vision. First,
we find that impressions must emanare from the visible object, as
Aristotle has shown to be the case in every kind oi sensation. Vision
is a virtus passiva3 but the passive must resemble the active, which
in this case is the visible object Thus the species, or impression, is
a likeness ol the object. These species are throvn out as from
a centre along every possible radius. Vision then takes place by the
radiation oi species, especially by those os light and colour. Colour
has much to do vith vision. A strong colour impression remeius
in the eye aiter the object has ceased to act on it. The species of
light are even moreessentialthan those olcolour . . . tuat
