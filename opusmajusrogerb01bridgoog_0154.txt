CHAPTER V.

Many observatione ol natural objects show 100 dependence 01
0010111 00 100 angle at which the light falls, as 101 instance the
plumage 01100 peacock's tail or the pigeon’s neck, and also the rain·
bow, as we shall see in dealing with experimental science. Drunken
men or those in wealr health see their own image projected in 11001
01 thern. Seneca explains this by a supposed feebleness 01 100
radiations proceeding 11010 their eyes, which instead 01 penetrating
the air are reflected back as 11001 0 1011101 10 10011 0011100; 01111 100
eye thus perceives the body 10 which 11 belongs. lt may be supposed
that the air round persons in this condition is specially charged with
morbid vapours, capable 01 reflecting the radiation. On this hypo·
thesis it is objected that the strongest radiations from sound eyes
would be ultimately reflected 110111 100 clouds But their distance
and their uneven 01111000 prevent such reflexion. In the ease 01
drunken or weak persons we need not accept Seneca's view 01
0010001100011010 the eye reflected from vapour. We may suppose
100 emanations from 100 object, i. e. 11001 the person, to 00 weak and
10 be easily stopped, and so to become an object 01 direct vision. ’100
