separately. Species in lact act iu this respect as do their agents,
and as do their completed effects. Alhazen thus explains the unity
oi impression resulting from species of an object entering the two
eyes; they are united in the braio. But iispecies are thus mixed,
how do we recognize various objects as distincti Because through
the point os mixture some rays come perpendicularly from the object
to the eye, others come to this point obliqueiy3 these latter are
eclipsed by the former. We may remark further that the various
parts oi the agent are always active: tbe generation os the species
is therefore continuous. Species unrelated to one another do not
commingle3 they exist separately and simultaneously . . 511-516

CHAPTER 1.

We have now to consider how and why species are wealrened in
their transit. ls there resistance in the medium? There is. For
every agent produces rarefaction and condensation‚ as the first process
in every natural action. What is rare resists condensation‚ and con·
versely. Thereiore every medium offers resistance. Further, there
is a practical limit to rarefaction. lt may be said that resistance is
only offered by contraries, and that, to many agents generating
species, nothing is contrary, in the sense iu which darkness is contrary
to light. But the resistance is not to the species themselves, but
to the proccsses oi rarefaction or condensation which accompany
them ............ 517-518

lt is obvious that species, so long as they continue to radiate, and
are not arrested by an accumulation oi such materiai as will intensify
their action (as in the case of fire acting on fuel), are weairened by
distance. The senses are less affected by a distant than a near
object. Two causes may be assigned. lt is said to be a law that,
as the first species is weaker than the agent, so the second is wealrer

than the first, and so ou. This, however, is not invariable. If iron
be held at some distance irom a magnet, the iron is more affected

than the air between them. So a ray, passing through coloured glass,
produces a st'ronger effect on a distant wall than on the intermediate
air. Another reason maybeassigned. The agent radiatesiorce in
all directions. Muchforce is dispersed thus. And though, for special
reasons, the soree in any one line may be iound not to grow wealter,
yet it will be so where the medium is ordinarily pervious. Thus both
distance aud radiant dispersion account ior the wealreuing oi species.
