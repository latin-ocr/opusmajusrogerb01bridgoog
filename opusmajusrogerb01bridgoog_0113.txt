CHAPTER 1.

Light and other forces not merely propagate themselves hy
multiplication os species, but work ulterior effects3 light produces
beat, heat putrefaction, putrefaction death, and so on. To these
effecte the same law applies. Rectilinear action is more effective
than curvilinear; perpendicular thau oblique. ln refractior the

- effect is greater than in reflexion, because in the latter the reflected
and incident rays neutralize each other. ln refractior action is

stronger where the second medium is denser than the first, because
the ray is deflected towards, not away from, the perpendicular. ln

reflexion more is done by oblique rays than by perpendicular. With
the latter there is neutralization ol incident and reflected rays.
Further, there can be but one perpendicular ray, but infinite numbers
ol oblique; and these may allhemade to converge . . . lle-123

CHAPTER 11.

The rays of which a natural action consist form, as we have seen, -
a cone. ln the shorter eones the strength os the action is promoted
first by greater proximity oi the agent, secoudly by the greater
proximity of the contermina} rays aiter intersection. On the other
band in the longer eones, the rays before intersection are the nearer
to each other, and in this respect the action will be more potent
But the first os these conditione will outweigh the second . . 123-124 ’

CHAPTER 111.

When two equal spheres intemct, the half oi each which is awerted
from the other is unafsected; the extreme rays from each can only
embrace the half oi the other sphere But with unequal spheres, the
less receives rays irom less than the hemisphere os the greater, which
touch more than its own hemisphere. From each point os a sphere
rays issue into space outside os the tangent plane. of these rays
only one is perpendicular to the surlaee This is the potent ray.
Rays vertical to a sphere are divergent. But when the object ot
vision is very remote, as in the case ol stellar bodies, they appear
to us to be parallel: just as the walls of a house seem parallel,
although their lines of direction converge to the earth's centre. 124-127
