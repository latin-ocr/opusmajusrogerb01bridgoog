CHAPTER XVI.

vor. 1. encas
When two equal welghts are placed in the scales oi a balance, and
one scale isdepressed, the lower scale being nearer the earth’s centre,
will have greater gravity. But this is counterbalanced hythe
tendency os the upper scale to sall in a curve ol more rapid descent
thau the lower. The oscillation ol the arms ot' the balance above and
below the horizontal is due to the motion communicated to the

surrounding air .......... tot-174

THE APPLICATION OF MATHEMATICS TO SACRED
SUBJECTS ......... 175-404

We have now seen the potencyot' mathematics as applied to things
secular. We now pass to its application to things divine Philosophy
is impossible without mathematice: theology without philosophy.
All knowledge is contained, directly or indirectly‚ in Scripture.
Therefore lor the right understanding of scripture, knowledge ol
nature is needlul. ln scripture there is a double meaning, literal
and spiritual. The first is necessary lor the second: and, as we have
shown, mathematical knowledge is necessary lor it. lt is certain that
the patriarche studied mathematical science and transmitted it to the
Chaldaeans and Egyptians, whenceit cameto the Greeks. This is
proved by Josephus, and confirmed by Jerome and other doctore, and
also by such philosophers as Albumazar. Further, the fathers have
themselves extolled the value ot' mathematical science, as may be
shown hy passages from Cassiodorus, Augustine. bede and others.
The importance of mathematics to theology may be considered under
seven heads .......... 175-180

first head. Knowledge os the heavens. Astronomy shows
the insignificance ol the earth as compared with the heavens. The
smallest ol the stars is larger than the earth, and the largest star is
insignificant compared with the space ol the sky. The earth can
be traversed at foot pace in three years. A star moving with immense
velocrty takes thirty-six thousand years to compass the heavens
Further, it is to astronomy that we loolr lor solution ol many theo-
logical problems, as for the substance of which the heavens are made,
the position ol paradise andos hell, the influente of heavenly bodies
upon the things ol earth. Again many obscurities in the text ol
Scn'pture can only be cleared up by astronomical research . 180-183

'l'he second head is that os sacred geography. By geography,
which is dependent on astronomy, we can determine the precise
position and the physica] conditions ol the places named in scripture.
