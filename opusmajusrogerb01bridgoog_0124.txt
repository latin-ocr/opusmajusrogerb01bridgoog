March 22. Eut the winter solstice and the vernal equinox are no

longer on these days. At the present time the winter solstioe is -

on December 13, the vernal equinox on March 13, the summer
solstice on June 15, the autumnal equinox on September 16. ln
every 125 years the error ol another day accumutnes The con-
sequence os this error is that Ea'ster is observed at tbe wrong
time, in the third and in the lourteenth years ol the lunar cycle

The error will be lar more serious in t'uture cennrries, so that
ultimately the period when Lent should be ohserwed will be at a

time when every one is eating meat ..... til-274

Further‚ there is a serious error in the computation ol the lunar
cycle. Successive periods of nineteen years differ in length, some
containing lour, others live leapyears. 'l'ne only· satisfactory period
would be thirty Arah years ol twelve lunatione, making 10‚631days‚
lt is true that the Couneil ol Nice adopted the lunar cyele; and
120 years altenvards it was confirmed by Pope leo. 'l'ne error at
tbis latter period was not more than a day. Sinoe that time astro·
nomy has been in disrepute, lor reasons already· mentioned, ann no
one has been lound who could clearly indicate the error, with
sufficient authority3 although in the time oi Pope Hilary some con·
sideration was given to the subject. At the present time the error
is so great as to attmct the-ridicule ol Jewish and Arub astronomers,

and deserves the serious attention ol the ruler ol the Church . tto-285

We now pass to the intluence ol the beavens upon things terrestrialr
ln allthings that are brought forth on earth, whether lorgood or evil,
the sun and the heavens are the moving cause. We bave therefore
to consider the different ways in which different parts ol the earth's
surlaee are-affected by these agencies Imagining that suriace

divided hythe equatur and the equinoctial oolure into four equal .

portione, we have specially to consider the portion oontained between
tlte equatur and the poles, bounded east and west hy the oolure.
What proportion does land bear to water? Ptolemy thought one·
elath, but other authorities thinlr the proportior much greater.
Seneca and Pliny loolt on the space ol ocean dividing the west oi
Spain lrorn the east of lndia as inconsiderable Under the word
Spain we must include a vast tract extending westwards across the
Straits oi Gibraltar, in the direction ol Atlas On the whole, it meurs
probahle that the land known to us lrorn east to west extends over
more than halt the earth's circumference. further, it seems probante
