thern worthily. We must distinguish between those who ³122&lessss

gling towards true wisdom, aud those who have attained it. We can
at least resolve not to bow down before wealth as a blessing, not to
be the slaves of it, always to hold ourselves iu readiness to abandon
it. Strange indeed is the tendency in bad mento malign men better
than themselves, instead of attacking oue another; to pick out the
specks in these, heedless of their own hideous eruptions. Yet
they only bring into greater prominence the virtue which they
assault ........... ass-347

CHAPTER xlx.

We must pursue our steady course, not diverted from it by the
varying blasts of opinion. We shall incur the reproach that a philo-
sophie life involves abandonment of the duties of a citizen But in
retirement we remain active, still working at what will be of use to

lives useful to others. We may serve the state by advising and
directing the young, as well as by holding public offices. We are not
to fiee from men and live only for ourselves. We remain citizeus;
but of the world, not merely of a single state. We act on those
around us by the influeuce of example Socrates under the Thirty
Tyrants was a tower of strength to his fellow citizens. lt is well
carefully to measure our own powers, which we are apt to overrate
Defects of temper, ‘health, fortune, often unfit us for public life, and
point to retirement as the better course. We should not begin what
we cannot carry through. Great care should be taken in the choice
