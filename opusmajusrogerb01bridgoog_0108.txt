but as children ever growing and learning: what we know is due to
those who have gone before us; it is for us, if we are not dolts, to

n supply their shortcontings. As Christiana it is our duty to avail

ourselvee oi their teaching as the foundation of our more perfect
doctrine, some glimpses of which. due to the tradition ot' the primitive
patn'archs, were not denied to heathen writers . . . . 5659

CHAPTER XV.

Such glimpses are to be found in the Sibyls, who prophesied of
the death of Christ and of the last Judgernent Divine truth, as
Augustine has said, was not confined to the seed of Abraham. Job
believed in the Resurrection ........ aaut

CHAPTER xvt.

There are two principles of metaphysic which will lead us to the
same conclusion. The first is that the business of philosophy is to
furnish a criterion of knowledge. lt is aware of the incompleteness
of its own knowledge in those matters which are of the greatest
importance. lt concludes from the goodoess of God that such know· Ι
ledge must have been somewhere revealed: it finds this revelation
in the Christian church; and shows that Christian doctrine supplies
the complement to its teaching which hitherto had been wanting . 61-62

CHAPTER XVll.

Secondly, we must consider that all speculative philosophy has
moral philosophy for its end and aim. The two are co-ordinated.
As the speculative philosophy of antiquity is related to the moral
philosophy of that time, so must our own speculative philosophy be
related to the moral philosophy of the Christian time, in other words,
to Christian theology. llut Christian ethic, as all authorities admit,
assumes the previous existence of heathen ethic So therefore must
it be with the speculative philosophy of Christiana lt starts with the
speculative theories of antiquity and carries them many stages farther.
And in so doing the Christian theorist will not merely select from his
heathen predecessors those truths the relation of which to theology
is manifest. l·le will embrace all truths without distinction, arranging
each in the division to which it belongs; confident that att truth, in
whatever department, will conduce in one way ot another to that
which is divine .......... 62-64

CHAPTER XVlll.

We see then that wisdom was revealed in its fullness to the first
patriarchs; that, through the impostore of those who followed them,
