clxxiv ANALYSIS: MULTIPLICATION OF SPECIES.

wood, is called fire. This, however, is only true when the patient is

corruptible3 when the patient is incorruptible, the case is otherwise.

The sun does not communicate its nature to the moon and planets

by shining on them. The species ol light is completed in them, but

not the species ol the sun. And generally it would be truer to say

that the patient was assimilated through the species to the nature ol

the agent, than to speak ot' the patient losing its identity in that

ol the agent ........... 413416
(c) Natural agents produce the same species whatever be the

nature ol the patient3 in other words, their action is unilorm This

does not apply to agents possessing free-will, except in so lar as they

may resemble natural agents. The difference in the patient may

bring about a different result, b'ut the species is the same . . 417-418

CHAPTER ll.

(a) We have now to inquire what are the things which generate
species. First‚ all qualities that act on sense, producing some change
in the sense-organ. There may be a doubt as to sound. Here
there isa tremor in the part ol the object struck: this tremor is com·
municated to the adjacent part, and so again to the next. The first
tremor makes a sound; sodoes the seoond and the third; but the
second sound does not corne lrom the first sound; it eomes from its
owntremor.. . .. . . . . . . . . 418-419
(b) Do substances generate species? Assuredly, since substances
are nobler than accidente. Au accident is not generated until its
subject be first generatcd. Heat, the accident, is posterior to fire,
the substance. When beat appears in water, fire must pre-exist, and
the substantial nature ot' fire, and this we call the species of the
substance fire. Such species are not cognizable hythe five senses, or
by sensus communis. But they are cognitable by a mental process,
ahin to that which causes the sheep instinctively to llee lrom the onl
which it has never before seen, feeling something injurious in its
proximity. lt is sometimes said that substance can have no contrary:
but there is a sense in which substances, or substantial forms act in
opposition ........... 419-423
(c) The species ol substance is ol the whole compound; he. ol
matter and form, not ol lorm alone ...... 423-424
(d) Every corporeal substance can produce species, therefore also
the organs ol sense. The species generated by the organs ol sense
are concerned in sensation ........ 424-425
(e) With regard to matter, which is passive, it may be affirmed

that it does not generate species, except in solatas compounded with
lorrn ............ 425-427

(s) Light and coluur generate species, but other properties ol body,
