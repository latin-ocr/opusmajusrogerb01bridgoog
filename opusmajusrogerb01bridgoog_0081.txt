enabled a series of observatione to be made of the angle of
refraction, in different media, on which the true law of the
variations of refraction at different angles and in different
rnedia might ultimately be based. Vitello ¹, Bacon's contem·
porary‚ drew upa table of refractions‚ as Ptolemy had done
before him, for the three media of air, water, and glass. lt
was soon seen that the angle of refraction did not vary in
accordance with the angle of incidence. But more than three
centuries were to pass before the discovery of the law of
sines, that is to say, the law that the ratio of the sines
of the angles of incidence and refraction is constant for
refraction in the same medium, was effected by Snell and
Descartes. .

lt might seem, at first sight that the optical work of Bacon
was little more than an abridgement of that of Alhazen ². But
this view would render Bacon but scanty justice. Problems
of great importance were indicated by him which Alhazen had
entirely neglected. ln considering the point on the axis of
a spherical concave mirror to which rays were reflected, Bacon
remarks that this point would be different for rays reflected
from each concentric circle traced round the centre of the
mirror. Such a mirror failed therefore to produce complete

¹ Of Vitello, or witelo, very little is known. lle describes himself ln his
dedication to William of Morbeta (identified by Cantor as William of
Moerbekel ss filius Thuringorum et Polonorum. ln lib. x. 74 of his work he
speaks of Poland as his country, and other passages (x. 42 and 67) show
thafhe travelled in ltsly. His work on Optics was edited with great care, and
with many emendations, by Risner. and published at Bale in 1572 in the
same volume that contained Risner’s edition of Allrazen. lndeed, it may
be described with little exaggeration as a revised edition of Alhazen's work;
with many additions certainly from other authors, but with noue of those
acknowledgements of bis principal tencher of which Bacon's Perspectr'va is full.
Vitello's tables of refraction have excited much admiration. They prove, bow-
ever‚ on careful examination to be an almost exact repetition of those of Ptolemy.
Whetber Bacon and Vitello ever came into contact there is no evidence
to show. Bacon was always ready to mention the sources of his knowledge.
Not so Vitello. lf he borrowed from Bacon. be would not have said so.

¹ lt must be owned that where Bacon differed from Alhazen, the advantage
was not always on bis side. Alhazen contended vigorbusly against the view of

the older oculists that vision took place by visual force issuing from the eye, .

maintaining that the ray proceeded to the eye from tbe object. Bacon (vol. ii.
pp. 49 sal. makes a fruitless attempt to conciliate these opposite views.
