at the position ol the cloud. ΤΙιε movement of the sun from east

to west during the appearance ol the rainbow may be left out ol
account ........... 185-190

CHAPTER Vlll.

The colours in the bow arise from an ocular deception. They are
analogous to those which appear when the eyes are weak or hall-shut
They are not due to the same cause as the colours produced when
light shines through a crystal, since these do not, like the oolours ol
the rainbow, shift with the position ol the observer . .- . reolo-2

CHAPTER lx.

Each drop ol rain in the cloud is to be regarded as a spherical
mirror; these being small and close together, the effect is that ol
acontinuous image rather than ol a multitude ol images The colour
isdue to the distortion ol the image caused by the sphericity ol the
mirror · ........... 192·193

CHAPTER X.

. The diversity ol colours has been attributed to varieties in the
texture ol the cloud, the denser parts producing violet and bine, the

lighterpartsred and orange. But we see the same colours in the dew· ¹
dropS, where there can be no such differences ol density; similarly in

the crystal. Aristotle hasbeen wrongly translated and interpreted

in this matter. Another erroneous heliel is that lunar rainbows occur
only once in fifty years. They may occur at any lull moon under
suitable atmosphericconditions ....... 193-194

CHAPTER Xl.

The shape ol the bow is a difficulty. lt cannot be explained by
refraction. lt is to be observed that the same colour is continued all
round the circle in each ring. All parts ol the ring therefore preserve
the same relation ot' the solar ray to the eye. This implies circularity
ol lorm. lt is aslred why the whole space contained by the circle is
not occupied with colour. Because lrom the points in this central

area rays equal to the angle ol incidence are not reflected to the
eye ............ llll-196

CHAPTER XII.

The cloud therefore is not coloured ; the appearance ol colour, lor
it is only an appearance, is given by rays reflected lrom the raindrops.
ot colours there are five, white, blue, red, green, blaclr: though
Aristotle, dividing blue and green into other shades, spcalrs ol seven.
