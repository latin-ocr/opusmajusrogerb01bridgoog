ASTROLOGY. lxi·

By Dante's master in theology, Thomas Aquinas, the reality
of astrological influences is laid down with perfect eleamess
in S. T. Pars Prima (quaest. 1¹5, art. 3 and 4). In the
first instance the question is put whether heavenly bodies are
a cause ol things that talre place in terrestria} bodies. This
alter the usual statement os reasons, lor and against. is answered
emphatically in the affirmative. ‘Celestial bodies causally
affect all the varied motions ol terrestrial bodies¹.' The second
question is, Are heavenly bodies a cause os human actions?
The authoritative conclusion here is, Directly speaking, they
are not. but indirectly they are ². ‘Indirectly‚ and by accident,
impressions ol celestial bodies may reach intellect and will,
since both intellect and will receive somewhat from inferior
faculties which are bound up with bodily organs A dis.-
tinction is, however, to be made between will and intellect.
The intellect is of necessity affected by the lower apprehen-
sive saculties os imagination. thought, or memory. and when
these are stirred, the intellectis stirred likewise. But the
will does not ol necessity follow the promptings ol the
lower appetite. For although the passions of anger and
desire have a certain power os moving the will; yet it
remains in the power of will to follow passion or to repu-
diate it Thus the influence os celestial bodies, so sar as
it produces change in the lower faculties, has to do rather
with intellect than with will; and will is the proximate cause
os human aetion.¹

Finally Aquinas remarks that ‘most men follow passions,
which are motions ol the sensitive appetite; and with these
heavenly bodies may have to do. For few are the wise who
withstand such passinus. And thus it is that astrologers
may osten loretell truly; but lor the most part rather in
general than in special, since nothing hinders any one man

¹The words are: ‘Corpora caelestia cum tanturn mobilia sint secundum
lationis motum, causa suut omnium eorum quae in his corporibus interioribus
variis motibus aguntur!

'‘Cum intellectus et voluntas, quae humanorum actuum principia sunt,
corporeis organis vires alligatae minime sint; non possunt corpora ipsa caelestia
humanorum actuum causae directe esse, sed indirecte, agendo per se ln corpora
quae ad utriusque potenn’ae opera conducunt’
