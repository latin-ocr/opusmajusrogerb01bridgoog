South India is the island of Taprobane abotmding in gold and jewels,

and governed peaceably by an elected lring with a council . 309—le
The south coast ot' lndia passes from the south tropic north-west,

cutting the equator at Arym, a point ninety degrees from the vvest,

but more than that from the east„ Then the coast line proceeds

south-west, passing the opening ol the Red Sea, and bounding South

Ethiopia till the lndian Sea joins the Atlantic. On the Nile at the

latitude os sixteen degrees, we find the island ol Saba, the royal city

ol Aethiopia-called also Meroe, about 7⁰⁰ miles from the coast. At

the same latitude, on the Red Sea, is the city oi Ptolemais Between

these two, or more probably to the west οἱ Meroe, is Berenice the city

oi the Troglodytes, who are identified with the Garamantes West

of these are the Hesperi ........ 310 als
Egypt is the region included between Syene and the Mediterra-

nean: divided into upper Egypt or the Thebais, and the Delta.

· The Delta extends from Heliopolis on tlte Arabian frontier to

Alexandria on the contines oi Africa. Attica received its name

from arte, a descendant oi Abraham. Before this it had been called

libya. Much oi the northern coast was occupied by Medes,

Persians, and Annenians brought by Hercules. The interior was

occupied by Gaetuliam, afterwards called Numidians, mtongst whom

the Carthaginians established their empire. Between Carthage and

Egypt are Tripolis and Cyrene ....... ola-318
Something must be said oi the Nile lts origin is in Aethiopia,

probably in the region bordering on the Red See„ lts courseis for

a long tiore westwards as iar as Meroe. Between Meroe and Syene

it is northward. and so onward to the Delta. lts inundatlon is in

summer. henoe the difficulty ol explaining it. The opinion os Thales

that it was due to northern vinds preventingthe outllow, is disproved

by the lact that the inundation begins in the upper part oi the river.

Α more probable view is that os Anaxagoras, that it is due to the

melting ol snow in the ntountains oi Aethiopia hristotle rejects

this view, but gives reasons for supposing a great rainfall to occur

n summer titne in the marshy regions from which the Nile

The region from the eastern bank ot the Nile is to be regarded

as part oi Arabia, which also includes the vast space eastward as

iar as the Persian guli and northward through south and east

Palestine as iar as the Euphrates. We can now traoe the principal

positions ol the Hebrews in the Desert, and also ol Edom, oi Moab

and oi other neighbouring tribes mentioned in the Scriptores . tto-³32
Τὴε region between the Tigris and the Euphrates is Assyria or

Mesopotamia, in which were the cities oi Nineveh, Aram, and
