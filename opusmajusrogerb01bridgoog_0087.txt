lxxviii INTRODUCTION.

Physics. After chemistry carne the study of living bodies,
on which Bacon‚ while assigni'ng to this science its natural
place in the series, has said little or nothing. But on the
study of plants and animals was based, under the name of
Medicina, the study of ‚the physical structure and functions
of man. Here Bacon had for his guides, not Galen indeed,
to whom his references are few, but Avicenna, Haly‚ and
a host of Arabian professors of medical art, to whom Galen
had supplied a very substantial foundation of anatomical and
physiologica! knowledge. Bacon's short treatise, to which
reference is occasionally made in the Opus Majus, De re·
tardandis senectutis accidentibus, will sufficiently illustrate
his views on this branch of science.

- Last among the series of the natural sciences comes that

which Bacon denotes as ‘Scientia Experimentalis.‘ The
sample of it, for it can hardly be regarded as more than
a sample, given in the sixth section of the Opus Majus
indicates that it was connected in Bacon's mind with no special
department of research‚ but was a general method used for
the double purpose of controlling results already reached by
mathematical procedure, and of stimulating new researches in
fields not as yet opened to inquiry.

In some respects this is the most original part of his work.
Not that experiment was a new thing. Experiments without
number had been made by man from the time of his first
appearance on the planet. The Greeks towards the end of
their marvellous scientific career had begun to use experiment
in their investigations of natural truth. Galen had applied it
in his researches into the nervous system ; Ptolemy had arrived
by its means at his remarkable discovery of the refraction of
light. The Arab astronomers, far more skilful mechanicians
than the GreekS,had constructed extremely elaborate apparatus
for the same purpose, and also to verify the equality of the

angles of incidence and reflection. But no one before Bacon α

had abstracted the method of experiment from the concrete
