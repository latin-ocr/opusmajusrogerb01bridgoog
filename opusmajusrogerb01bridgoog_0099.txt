xc ’ INTRODUCTION.

seems to me that sufficient attention has not yet been called,
is the sense of historical continuity by which it is pervaded.
Not indeed that Bacon stood alone in this respect. Comte,
in a remarkable passage ol bis appreciation of the mediaeval
Church, called attention, perhaps for the first time, to the
awakening of the historic sense which the very constitution
of that Cburch involved; rising as it did from the threefold
root of Roman law, Greek thought, and Hebrew theocracy
(Philosophia Posilive, vol. v. p. 247, ed Litne). As an example
of this influence, he proceeds to quote the example of Bossuet,
one of the first of European thinkers to form, in however
imperfect a way, a broad and definite conception of the unity
of history. But the example of Roger Bacon, writing four
centuries earlier, is even stronger and more startling. Two
centuries before the Renascence‚ he states explicitly what
others may have implicitly thought, but would have sbrunk
from avowing even to themselves, that the whole course of
intellectual development of mankind from the beginning of the
world was not multiple but one, not discrete but continuous.
He takes pains to synchronize the demigods, the heroes and
the thinkers of Grcece with tbe kings and prophets of Judaea.
In his conception, philosophy, science, and religious truth had
a common origin with the patriarchs: though separated in
later centuries, they pursued a parallel course in Judaea and
in Greece. The growth of science, no less than the growth
ol religion, was a process ol continuous evolution, taking place
⁴ under divine guidance. It may be said that traces of such
a doctrine as this may be found bere and there in the early
fathers, and especially in the writings of St. Augustine. But
a comparison os the ninth and tenth books of De Ciuitate Dei
with the second and seventh sections of the Opus Majus, will
reveal aprolound difference in the mode of treatment, even
more than in the conclusions reached. What the earlier
’ writer looks at as concessione wrung from an opponent, the
later hails as the testimony of a friend. Augustine dwells on
the points that separate the Christian from Porphyry and
Seneca; Bacon on the points of union.
