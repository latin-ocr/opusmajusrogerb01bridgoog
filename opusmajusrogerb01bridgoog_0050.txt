the unity os matter, Bacon met by a bold denial ol such
unity. ‘Divide et impera,' he said in ellect3 matter, thus
split up into sections, is no longer to be secred.

Looking at Bacon's theory by the light ol subsequent cen·
turios, it is not difficult to see that its value lay in its solvent

and destructive power. His aim· from beginning to end oi
his career was to draw men away from verbal subtleties and

concentrate them on the realities os lile, as plain men under·
stand them. ‘You ask me,' he would say to the young
students around him, ‘what is this matter which remains apart
lrom all sorm, with capacity lor receiving all? But who told'
you that it was one and indivisible? There areas many kinds
and degrees of matteras there are ol things. Look at the
things, try them, see how they act on you, how you can act

on them. As to the matter and lorm that may underlie
them, leave that to God’
Bacon’s part in the great controversy between realism and

nominalism will lead us to a similar conclusion. It was a less
burning controversy in the thirteenth century than iu the days
os Roscelin and Abelard‚ or than it became afterwards in the
days os Duns Scotus and William of Oclrham3 and it was
debated by Albert and by Aquinas with the sar larger and
deeper understanding os its complications, that might be
expected from men who were not merely trained like their
predecessors in the study of Aristotle’s Logic, but had become
conversant with the problems raised in his Physic and
Metaphysic. Both these thinkers rejected the independent
existence ol universals in re as clearly as Aristotle had
done. They were clear that universals had no existence
except in the mind. ‘Non est universale nisi dum intelli·
gitur' (Albert. Met. lib. v. tract. vi. cap. 7). ‘Una et eadem
natura quae singularis erat et individuatur per materiam in
singularibus hominibus efficitur postea universalis per actionem
intellectus depurantis illam a conditionibus quaesunt hic et
nunc’ (Aquinas, Τ ructatus primus de universalibus). N ever-
