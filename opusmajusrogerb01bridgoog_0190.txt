on, which is specially potent, and has the greatest penetrative power.
lt is to be noted that says prooeeding from a very distant source
appear parallel, though in reality they are not so: so the' walls ol
a house seem parallel to each other, though in reality each is directed
to the centre ol the earth ........ tet-498

CHAPTER X.

Optical principles teach us that in looking at a sphere the visual
cone embraces less than half the surface. In considering the portion
os a convex or concave surlace that can be illuminated bya source ol
light, we have to determine to what portion of it rectilinear rays can
proceed from the illuminating point without impediment. ln the
mutual action of two spheres, more than hall the surlace ol the smaller
is involved, less than hall ol the larger ..... 498-501

CHAPTER 1.

We have now to consider the nature ol species as existing in the
medium. Many have regarded it as body. But this is misleading.
To speak ol it as body would imply that it was something which
divided the surrounding medium, having three dimensione of its own.
But the species has no dimensions other than those of the medium in
which it is generated. During the generation ot' species from the
medium, the medium does not lose its corporeal character, nor is any
new body created or added. The species is simply a portion of the
medium wrought on in a peculiar way hythe agent. Though so
wrought on as to resemble the agent, yet the substance ol which it is
formed is that of the medium ....... boa-504

But the species moves onward in space, while tlre medium remains
at rest: how can the species be said to have the bodily substance ol
the medium? The reply is that the species successively formed are
notnumericallyidentical. What takes place is the successive genera·
tion from point to point ol something new, as in the oese of a shadow
apparently shilting its position, bnt which is really being constantly
renewed. lt is asked why does not the movement ol the air by wind
affect the direction ol the species? The reply is that the force
exerted by the agent is in a definite direction and renews the species
in each portion ol air as it is driven by. ln the case, again, ol reflex-
ion, there is no violent casting back of the species: it simply pursnes
the only path possible to it. What we call species is not one identical
