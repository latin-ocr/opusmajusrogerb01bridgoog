lxvi INTRODUCTION.

which emanate lrorn thern, and are conveyed through space
with incredible velocity. These maybe called images. Their
flow frorn bodies is continuous so that they are not separately
perceived.' The description of thern by Lucretius is more
definite and better known. “Pictures ol things and thio
shapes are emitted lrom things off their surlace3 these are
like films or may each be named a rind, because each image
bears an appearance and form like to the thing, whatever it is,
from whose body it is shed and wanders sorth' (Lucretius
iv. 40, Monro's translation). And again, ‘Many idols are be·
gotten in a short time, so that the birth ol such things is with
good reason named a rapid one. And as the sun must send
lorth many rays ol light in a short time in order that all things
may be continually filled with it, so also sor a like reason
there must be carried away from things in a moment os time
idols ol things, many in number, in many ways, in all directions
round. . . . As soon as ever the brightness os water is set down
in the open air, il the heaven is starry‚ in a moment the clear
radiant constellations ol aether imaged in the water correspond
to those in the heaven. Now do you see in what a moment
os time an image drops down from the borders os heaven to
the borders ol earth ’ (Lucretius iv. 159 and ιιι). He goes on
to explain that not the sense ol sight only, but all the senses,
are affected by these emanations

But it would be an entire misapprehension os Bacon's views
as to the propagation ol force to identisy them with the crude
physics ol Epicurus.

In the first place, Bacon wholly rejects the notion that the
species is something emitted from the agent, or acting body
(De Mult. Sper. pp. 432-438). lf it were so, the agent would
be weakened and ultimately destroyed by the emission‚ which
is not the case. Nor again does the agent create the species
out os nothing. Nor does it collect the species lrom sur-
rounding space and send it on into the body on which action
takes place—the patient. Nor, as some have supposed, does
the agent impress the patient as with a seal. ’

What happens is that the agent stimulates the potential
activity ol the matter os the patient. The species is generated
