languages should be rendered in Latin. The point is that
a man should be able to read these languages, and understand
their grammatica} structure (‘ accidentia partium orationis,'
Compendmm studii, Brewer, p. 43 3).

What Bacon’s linguistic attainments were cannot be pre-
cisely decided. No work of his, published or unpublished,
that I am aware of, affords evidence of knowledge of Arabic..
His own words in the twenty-fifth chapter of Opus Tertium
are scarcely decisive on the point. ‘De Arabica tango locis
suis ; sed nihil scribo Arabice, sicut Hebraea, Graece, et Latine,
quia evidentius et facilius ostenditur propositum meum in his.
Nam pro studio theologiae parum valet, licet pro philosophia
multum, et pro conversione infidelium? Some pages printed r
for the first time in this edition show acquaintance at least
with the Hebrew alphabet. An elementary Greek grammar,
in the possession of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, testifies to
his knowledge of Greek, which indeed is sufficiently apparent
in the present work, and still more in the ninth and following
chapters of the Corriperrdium Stadii (Brewer, pp. 495-519).
This grammar is incomplete, dealing chiefly with the alphabet,
with the Greek system of accentuation, aspiration, and
quantity, and with the numeral system. It concludes with the
paradigm of the verb τύπτω. ,Its opening sentence seems to
indicate that it formed a part of Bacon's encyclopaedic work.
‘Here begins the first book of the volume on the grammar of
languages other than Latin. This book deals with Greek
grammar.' ‘ 1 have already,' he continues, ‘ spoken ol the ad-
vantage to the Latin world of knowing. the four languages,
Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and Chaldaean; and in the preface to
this volume devoted to grammar Ihave explained the division
of subjects and their order. I now proceed to consider Greek
grammar, beginning with such rudiments as boys are taught in
Latin in order that they may read, write, and construe simple
passages, and may pass thence to points of greater difficulty?

Α point of interest presents itself as to Bacon's pronuncia-
tion of Greek. Mnch attention is given to the transliteration of
the Greek alphabet into its Latin equivalents. The Lord's
Prayer, the Salutation to the Virgin, and the Apostles’ Creed
