are written out in Latin, underlined first with the Greek words
in Roman character, and secondly with the same words in
Greek. The second of these is here given as an example:

Ave Maria gratiosa Dominus cum te benedicta
Chere Maria kecharitomeni ho Kyrios meta su eulogimeni
Χαῖρε Μαρία κεχαριτωμένη ὀΚύριος μετὰ σοῦ εὐλογημένη

tu in mulieribus et benedictus fructus ventris tui.
sy en gynexi ke eulogimenos ho karpos tis kilias su.
’σὺ έν γυναιξὶ καὶ εὐλογημένος ὁκορπὸς τῆς κοιλίας σοῦ.

Amen.
Amen.
Ἀμήν.

“ Ιι is evident from the transliteration ofvowels and diphthongs
here adopted, with which may be compared pp. 7 5-76 of the
Opus Majus, printed for the first time in this edition that these
were pronounced as in modern Greek ¹. lt appears also in the
subsequent discussion on accents, that accents were considered,
no less than quantity, in pronunciation. Bacon may not im·
probably have learnt the language from one of the Greeks
who had been invited into England by Grosseteste. Some
of these, he tells με, had become permanent residents. (ln

is treated.

ln urging so strongly the study of language, Bacon had two
main purposes in view: an improved text of the Bible, and an

¹ ln the Corpus Coll. Grammr, a systematic scheme of transliteration and of
pronunciation is also given. We learn from it that the second letter of the
alphabet was pronounced like the modern English v; and that there was no
single letter rendering the sonnd of our b. ‘ltem rr post μ vel v, sive in eadem

nostrum d, quod aliter non habent, ut dvrr'xprorosss All this is in accordauce
with modern Greek pronunciation. The transliteration of the diphthongs w
and εν was a matter of some difficulty owing to the confusion between u and ν.
Baton usually rendere them as as and eſs But in modern Greek it is only before
θ, rr, ξ, π, σ, τ, φ, χ, ψ, that they are thus pronounced; before other letters they
would have the sound of αν or ev. With regard to acceuts, Bacon’s language
(both in the Corpus MS. and in the compendium δικαία) puts it beyond all
doubt that they gevemed his pronuncistion of the language.
