ALCHEMY. lxxvii

rical information as to a few metals and their oxides, some of
the principal alkalis, acids, and salts. On all these things the ,
Arab investigators, from Geber downwards‚ had accumulated
a considerable mass of material lt is not easy to define
the results ol each inquirer, owing to the prevalent habit of
describing their procedure and results in mystical language.
Seli-defence against charges of magic and imposture was
probably their motive. And that the danger was real, the
history of Bacon’s life suffices to show. His efforts to refute
the charge ol magle were incessant. ln his treatise, De Secretis
Operibus Artis et Naturae et de nullitate Magiae, he describes
in detail the various procedures of the magician, sleight of
hand, ventriloquism, pretended movements of inanimate
things in dim light, the aid ol accomplices. utterance of mys·
terious formulae, invocation of spirits. We gather from the
description that the lapse of six centuries has done little to
change the character of charlatanism. But Bacon was aware
that the charlatan was often in possession of valuable secrets.
‘Many books are held to be magical,' he says, ‘which are not
really so, but which contain important truths; which are of
this kind, and which are not, it is for the experience of the
wise man to decide. lf he find in them any result of natural
or artificial forces (opus naturae vel artis), let him accept this;
otherwise let him reject them as worthless.' Bacon carefully
, guards himself against denial of the mystical force of words
uttered under solemn conditions, as in the daily miracle of
the Eucharist, or in the solemn invocations that protected
the innocent when exposed to judicial ordeal. Such powers
might be exerted for good as for evil; and the unlawful use
of them was strictly and severely to be condemned.

But to whatever extent Bacon may have shared the illusions
of his time with regard to the practical operations of alchemy‚
it isa striking proof of his scientific discernment that under
the head of Speculative Alchemy he should have formed a
clear, though distant survey‚ of chemical science as the inter-
mediate link between Aristotelian Physics and the science
of living bodies. As Physics followed on Mathematics so did
Chemistry, in Bacon's arrangement of the sciences, succeed
