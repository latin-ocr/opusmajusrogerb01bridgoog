demanding the most serious and systematic study. Rhetoric
was no mere held sor the gratification ol vanity by ornamental
display. It was a part ol logie, and the most important part,

lor the other parts: as the eye guides the whole body, and
the soot sustains it and leads it from placeto place. As with
an eye torn out, or a loot cut off, so is it with the different
departments of wisdom; none can attain its proper result
separately, since all are parts ol one and the same complete
