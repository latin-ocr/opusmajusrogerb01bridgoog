clxxxiv ANALYSIS: MULTIPLICATION OF SPECIES.

vot. 11. raons
When the direction of radiation is from terrestria! to celestial, it
might be thought that the increasing rarity of the medium would
compensate the weakening of the species from dispersion; hut the
second cause operates at a faster rate than the first F0r radiation
in the reverse direction, froin heaven to earth, there can, of course, be
no such compensation ........ 518-521

CHAPTER 11.

Supposing space were unlimited‚ could multiplication of species go
on indefinitely? Νο; for, as we have seen, the species grows con-
tinually weaker the further it is from its source. lf the supply of
matter on which it could operate were infinite, then no doubt the
action would be infinite, but this is not the ease. Ι t might be said
that, since matter is infinitely divisible, there would always remain
something on which the species, however enfeebled by distance,
could act; that therefore the duration of the action would be infinite.
But this seems a forced and unsatisfactory conclusion. Again‚ it
might be urged that the medium may grow continuaily more subtle so
as to correspond to the continual weakening of the species. But this
does not in fact take place. As a fact, the resistance, in our world,
which is finite, is always sufficient to prevent the species from
passing beyond a certain distance ...... 521-524

Supposing the existence oi a vacuum between earth and heaven,
no species could radiate; for no natural action can taire place iu
a vacuum. It follows also that beyond the ninth and tenth heavens

no species from the stars can radiate. For beyond these there is
nothing, not even empty space ....... 524-525

CHAPTER 111.

The radiation of force takes plane in time. For it involves change
in the medium; and change involves time. When the path of
propagationis refracted‚ more time is taken than when the path is
direct. F inite force cannot act instantaneously, for then it would be
equal to infinite force. As a point is toan instant, so is a line to
time. The passage of a point is instantaneous, in the passage oi a line
time is occupied. Translation implies before and after . . 525-526

·1t is said that the transit of light is instantaneous. Eut all that is
meant is that the time required is insensible. Aristode, in saying
this. is arguing against Empedocles, who regarded light as a substance
flowing from the luminous body. ln this case no doubt we should be
able to see its passage from east to west in the heavens. But the
view here taken of light is not that it is a body translated, but
a movement continuously propagated. Aristotle no doubt dis·
