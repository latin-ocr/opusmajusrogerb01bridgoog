xxxii INTRODUCTION.

and diffusion of science, no less than for the reform of the
Church. He found the great university immersed in dialec-
tical controversy. Many of the controverted questions were
of momentous importance, and Bacon was prepared to take
his part in thern. But they were prosecuted by men devoid
of scientific training, unprepared therefore to distinguish
truth from error, verbal subtleties from fundamental realities3
unwilling even to take the trouble to study Aristotle and
the Bible in their original language. He saw that philosophy
without science could not fail to degenerate (as history, ancient
and medem, shows that it always has degenerated) into .
academie pedantry, and would confirm that one of the aber-
rations of intellect which he looked on as the worst and the
most fatal, the false conceit of knowledge. Against ignorance
under the cloak of wisdom he urged, like Socrates, a lifelong
war; and, like Galileo, he met with a worse fate than that of
Socrates, the martyrdom of enforced silence.

No crusade has been conducted by blameless crusaders.
It cannot be denied that Bacon's indiscriminating zeal in·

as the constructive thinker who gave coherency to the vast
fabric of Catholic discipline, achieved results which, judged at
the distance of six centuries, Bacon neither equalled nor
approached. Jealousy of the rival Dominican Order, of
which these men were the chief ornaments, cannot account
for Bacon's failure to recognize their value3 for the lrre· .
fragable Doctor‚ Alexander of Hales, was a Franciscan, and
was criticized more harshly than either. In their failure to
appreciate duly the importance of scientific culture as a basis
of Catholic action on adoubting and unbelieving world,
the doctors of the Paris schools were all alike involved in
his unmeasured strictures. We may understand, though we
cannot justify‚ his inrpatience. He has bitterly expiated it by
many centuries of neglect.

It can hardly be doubted that the seclusiou consequent
