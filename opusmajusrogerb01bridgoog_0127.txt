Beginning with the coast, we find Gaza on the confines of Egypt
and Palestine, then proceeding northward Ascalon, Joppa, Azotus,
Caesarea, Acon, Tyre, Sarepta, Sidon, Barut, Gibeleth, Tortosa,
Laodicea. From this last to Antioch is two days’ joumey. From

Antioch to Tarsus in Cilicia three days’ joumey . . . satsat
Passing to the interior, we find Beer-sheba at the southern
houndary. Twcnty miles to the north is Hebron, the place of
sepulture of the patriarche. Near Hebron is Carmel, aud a little
to the east, the town and mountain of Zipb3 fourteen miles to the
north is Bethlehem, which is six miles to the south of Jerusalem.
This city is twelve leagues from Joppa, and nine leagues to the east
