BACON'S LIFE. xxix

delay, these works l'or the most part were still unwritten. Never·
thelees there were exceptions. He had compiled‚ he tells us,
from time to time, certain chapters on various subjects at the
instance os friends (Opus Tertium, cap. a). Among these
chapters is probably to be reckoned the treatise De Multipli-
cattbne Speciemm, which was sent to the Pope by the same
messenger who conveyed the Opus Majus, though it does not,
. strictly speaking, form a part ol that work. Caresul examina-
tion shows it to be a portion ol the more complete philosophical
treatise to the completion ol which Bacon always aspired, till
the time came, ten years afterwards, when his philosophical¹ .
career was iatally arrested. lts style is different from that os
the other three treatises‚ Mcy'us, Minus, and Tertium. Itis
not like these a Persuasin that is a more or less popular
discourse addressed to a reader like Clement IV ; a reader
ol keen understanding doubtless‚ but at the same time the
busiest man in Christendom. The Multiplicatio Specierum is
a fragment os a systematic work written with lull observance
ol philosophie language and ol the dialectic os the schools.

Whatever the discipline imposed during this period ol his
lise, one important sphere os activity undoubtedly remained
open to him. For many years he had been striving to lorm
a school ol young men, who should carry on the work which he
had begun. We have seen in the treatise which throws so
much light on the details os his life (Opus Tertium, cap. 17),
that he had been engaged lor a long time in instructing young
men in languages‚ in geometry, in arithmetic‚ in the construc-
tion ol tables, and in the use ol scientific instruments. From
this part ol his work he was evidently not cut off during his
lile in Paris from 1257 to 1267. The messenger whom he
selected to convey his manuscripts to Pope Clement was a poor
lad whom he had been training in this way lor five or six
years On the whole it seems probable that the restrictions
placed on his liberty atthis period ol his lile were notos
extreme severity.

Ol the reception given to Bacon’s manuscripts in Rome we
know absolutely nothing. A lew months alter their arrival
Clement lV died; and the papal see remained vacant lor
