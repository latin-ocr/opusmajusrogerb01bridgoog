THE OPUS Mallus xci

the centuries following the lall oi the Western Empire seem
a chasm hard to pass; so that they prefer, with Vico, to con·
ceive olan ancient civilization which has run its course, and
a new cycle as beginning. For Roget bacon the apparent
breach ol continuity was in great part filled up by the long
series of thinkers and students, who kept the torch ol science
alive in the Mahommedan schools os Mesopotamia and Spain.
A glance at the Index to this edition will show the use which
Bacon made oi such men as Thabit ben Corra, Aliarabius,
Allraganus, Alkindi‚ Alhazen‚ Albumazar, Avicenna‚ Hali,
and Averroes. They are spoken ol', and most truly, not

At the close ol these introductory remarks, some attempt

protests against the intellectual prejudices ol his time, his
lorecasts ol an age ol industry and invention, the prominence
given to experiment, alike as the test ol received opinion and
the gulde to new fields of discovery, render comparisou with
his great namesake ol the sixteenth century unavoidable. Yet
the resemblance is perhaps less striking than the contrast.
Between the fiery Franciscan, doubly pledged by science and
by religion to a lile os poverty, impatient ol prejudice,
intolerant os dullness, re'ckless ol personal lame or advancc-

ment, and the wisc man ol the world richly endowed with ,

every literary gift, hampered in his philosophical achieve·
ments bya throng ol dubious ambitionS, there is but little in
'common Iu wealth ol words, in brilliancy ol' imagination,
Francis Bacon was immeasurably superior. But Roger Bacon
had the sounder estimate and the firmer grasp oi that com·
