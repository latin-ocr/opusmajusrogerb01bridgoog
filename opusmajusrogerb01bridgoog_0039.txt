2. John Dee. in a memorial addressed to Queen Elizabeth
in 1582 on the reformation oi the Calendar, speaking oi
those who had advocated this change, says¹ : ‘ None hath done
it more eamestly‚ neither with better reason and skill, than
hath a subjectos this British Sceptre Royal done, named as
some think David Dee of Radik‚ but otherwise and most
commonly (upon his name altered at the alteration ol state
into iriarly profession) called Roger Bacon: who at large
wrote thereos divers treatises and discourses to Pope Clement
the fifth (sic) about the year os our Lord1267. To whom
he wrote and sent also great volumes exquisitely compiled oi
all sciences and singularities, philosophical and mathematical,
as they might be available to the state ol Christ his Catholic
Church.' Dee proceeds to give extracts from Bacon’s works
in proos oi these assertions; and remarks that Paul ol Middle·
burg, who was much occupied with the question oi the Calen-
dar, and had treated of itin his work Paulina de recta Paschae
celebratione, had made great use of Bacon, ‘ His great volume
is more than hals thereos written (though not acknowledged)‚
by such order and method generally and particularly as our
Roger Bacon laid out for the handling os the matter? When
we remember that it was Paul oi Middleburg by whom
Copemicus was urged with a view to this very problem to
construet more accurate astronomical tables, we shall gladly
acknowledge that here, too, Bacon's labour was not lost.

3. No part oi Bacon’s work was more frequently transcribed
than his Perspectiva. Based as it was upon the great work
of Alhazen‚ which was itself a development os the Optics ol
Euclid and Ptolemy, and claiming indeed to be but an
abridgement or condensation oi the truths laid down by his
predecessor with wearisome copiousness‚ it was in fact much
more than this. lt selected srom a mass of propositions‚

¹ Dee's memorial ls contained among the Bryan Twyne MSS. in Corpus
Christi College, Oxsord. The supposition that Roger Bacon changed his name
ntrance into the Franciscan Order appears to rest on no authority but that

ur Dee's very erratio imagination.
