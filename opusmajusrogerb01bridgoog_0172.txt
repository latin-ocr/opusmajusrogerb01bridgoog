they spent it wisely. But they waste it like spendthrifts, in luxury,
vice and sloth, or at the best in restless activity. Men cherish
adream of retirement and quiet reflection at the close of life. But
they put off realizing it till too late. We know how Angustus longed
for such a time of peace. The art of life is no easy matter to be
learnt in amoment. Life itselfis not too longior it. The vise man
knowing this guards his time against the encroachments both of
pleasure and business. Thus whatever his span of life he truly lives.
For length of years is no proof of life. The shipwrecked sailor, tost
hither and thither, has not made a voyage. Men crare for life when
they see the end of it at hand. But while it lasted they lavisbed it
recklessly. Much too is wasted in schemes for the morrow, the
immediate work before us beingleft undone. Time must be seized
as it flies. Of the three parts of time, past, present and future, the
first alone is our inalienable possession. Yet how few care to look at
it. The ambitious, cruel or intemperate man hates his memories.
The one part of life which is really his own he tiees from; and yet

collection of trivial and useless facts: [though be it said in passing
that sometimes these facts have philological interest 3] ivise men have
the whole expanse of history open to thern. They can escape from
the littleness of the present to companionship with the great thinkers
and teachers of past ages. All time belongs to such men. Tbey
recall the past: they act in the present: they arrange the future.
They see things to which other men are blind, and they escape,
other men’s miserable anxieties as to what may hefall them. lt is

well therefore to spare a few years for quiet meditation before our
faculties are enfeebled ........ 323-333

CHAPTER XVII.

lt is well for us not to be exempt from the common lot. Great
wealth is great slavery. Lite at the best is but a stormy voyage, and
the only haven is death. Life has been lent us; let us return the
loan nngrudgingly. And for the death of those dear to us, though we
must feel like men, letusalso bear like men . . . . 333—335

CHAPTER XVIII.

l now pass to Seneca's discourses on the Blessed Life, and on Peace
of Mind; for they are well adapted to strengthen the spirit and render
it careless of outward prosperity. Men wish for happiness, but know
not where to find it. lt is worse with them than with travellers who
