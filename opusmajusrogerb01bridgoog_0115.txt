cvi ANALYSIS OF THE ‘OPUS MAJUS.'

CHAPTER lV.

Passing to the torrid zone, it would seem that the region under the
equinoctial circle must he the honest, since twice in the year the sun's
rays there are vertical. But this is over-weighed hythe lact that
under the tropical signs the sun is nearly stationary. The matter is
further complicated hythe eccentricity ol the solur orbit. . 135-137

CHAPTER V.

The emanations from the stars affect not merely climate, but
character; inrplanting on the new-born child dispositione to good ’
or evil, to quick or to dull apprehension: though free will, God’s
grace, temptatione os the devil, or education rnay modily these innate
tendencies ........... lat—139

CHAPTER Vl.

Our theory may be applied to the tides. Tbese evidently depend
on the moon. When the rays fall obliquelyon the surfaoe, their
Ι effect is only to raise vapours irorn the surface and create ebullition

and a consequent flow ol water till the time comes when the rays fell
verticzdly, and with soree enough to extract the vapour; and then the
reliux begins. This however leaves it unexplained why the same
thing happens in the hemisphere averted from the moon. We must
suppose the ninth or starry heaven to be solid and impenetrahle and
that the vertical mys ol the moon are reflected from it, these
producing the same effect as the incident rays . . . . 139-142

CHAPTER Vll.

lhe application of these principles to the preservation oi lile and
health is obvious. Protection must be sought against the vertical
rays ol injurious emanations‚ as ol the moon at night, oi Satum and
Mars, oi persons infected with contagious disease, os the evil eye;

and we must adapt our bodies to the reception os emanations known
to he salubrious .......... 142-143

CHAPTER Vlll.

We may give mathematical disprool ol what is une os the greatest
errors in philosophy: nantely‚ that matter is of one kind only, the
differences ol substance resulting only from difference in somn The
consequence ol this error would be to elevate matter to equality with
