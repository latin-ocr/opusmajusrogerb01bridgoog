The rays, in this case, coming from the threads ol the web are so
nearly coincident with the rays coming t'rom the object, asto be con-

CHAPTER lll.

Of Perception through reasoning· Many examples can be given
os this. The most striking is our perception oi distance. An object
may be so distant, as to subtend so small an angle in the eye that
vision ceases. Short os that timii, the degree os distance is deter-
mined by a continuous series of objects between the object and the
eye. In a flat country we baveno means oi judging the height of
the clouds, which we can do when we see them on the sides or
summits oi mountains. [Clouds would appear to be oi no great
height, though, as we know lrom the factos twilight, exhalations
other than clouds may rise fifty-one miles. Such exhalatione are
not aqueous: being dry they retain the sun’s beat better, and thus
rise higher.] For judging, then, of distance, we must have an inter-
mediate series ol objects, each oi which shall be appreciable by the
eye with sufficient accuracy. These limits are soon exceeded.
Α line of trees appears continuone, though there may be a great
interval between each oi them. So planets seem to be in the same
sursace as fixed stars.- though the difference of remoteness is
immense. So an equilateral figure oi many sides becomes at
a distance undistinguishable from a circle. A circle may he taken
sor a straight line, a sphere ior a plane figure. When a circle is held
sideways before the eye, the part nearer to the eye will be recognized
as nearer it the distance is moderate: is it is very faroli, thedifferenoe
of distantes in the points bears so small a proportion to the whole
as not to be recognized. Thus it is that, when the moon is in her
first or third quarter‚ the circulor line defiuing the light part from the
dark appears as a straight line. So too the sun and moon seem to
us flat, though they are spherical ...... 106-108

CHAPTER tv,

All this is exemplified in the study of the Moon’s Phases The
base ol the cone os solar light occupying the moon's surface appears
to us twice in the month as a straight line3 otherwise as curved:
a lact unexplained in the Latin translations ol Aristotle and Averroes.
Here we have to leave the region os sense, and penetrate to the
real facts, which, but sor the remoteness ot' the suu and moon, we
should be able to see. The boundary os rays proceeding srorn one
eye to the moon is a great circle of that body; that of rays proceed-
ing from the sun to the moon is also a great circle, or nearly so. At
conjunction and at lull moon these circles coincide, the lunar surlace
