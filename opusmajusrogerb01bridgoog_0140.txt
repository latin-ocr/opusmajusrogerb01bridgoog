A third difficulty presents itself. The species from colours must
mix throughout the medium blaclr and white becoming grey, and
so on; the mixture of species having the resultas the mixture of
their originals. The cone reaching the eye would thus present no
distinctions of colour. The reply given by Aristotle, Averroes‚ and
others is that these species have only a spiritual existence, and do not
observe the laws of material forms. Any number of them therefore
may meet in the same point without being mixed. But this view is
profoundly erroneous. We shall find the true solution by recurring
to what bas been said before; the preponderating force of the rays
that fall vertically over all the rest Suppose the object to be
blaclr in the centre, white and red at the extremities. The blaclr in
their course will come into contact with white rays and red rays:
but these latter will be oblique, and will therefore not affect the
result. So with the rays from the white and the red parts of the
object ............ 39-42

CHAPTER lV.

Those who have spoken of species as spiritual, do not use that
word as it is used of God or the Soul: they mean imperceptible. But
such a nse of the word is confusing. The species resembles that of
which it is the image; it is therefore material lt posses through
a material mediurn; is therefore material. lt produces 'material
results; being related to that result as the incomplete to the com·
plete, as the embryo to the fully formed animal. Species are indeed
invisible, except it be by accident ; when an opeque body intercepts
the ray of light or colour, we become sensible of it. Or again, weak·
nese of sight may maire us sensible of the passage of the ray, though
we should nothe so otherwise. The same principle applies to objects
perceived by the other senses. lt may be aslred, How is it that three
candles placed near a small opening appear as three on the other
side? There is true mixture of the species in this case, for one
illumination results. Still if the eye be applied to the opening, the
distinction of the principal rays proceeding from each will make
itselt felt ............ 43-46
