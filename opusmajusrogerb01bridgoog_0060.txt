the minor workS, edited by Brewer‚ contain much for which in
the Opus Majus Bacon had not found romu. With regarcl

Martin may be consulted ¹. It appears that. towards the end
of the twelsth or the beginning os the thirteenth century. a taz-:tt
os the Bible had become generally current in Paris under the
title os ‘Textus Parisiensis.' Bacon, writing in [Ηῖιζῑὲ speaks os

these errors attracted notice, and attempts were marli:-ff prin-
cipally by members of the mendicant orders, tri correct thum.
But these attemptS, in Bacon's judgement, only resultet] in
making the matter worse. Each critic worked indemnis-*nim
and without adequate critical apparatus, Not merely did
Franciscan differ from Dominican‚ but the members ms each
Order differed amongst themselves, succa-ssime corrected
versions were put sorward, each worse than tha: preceding.
