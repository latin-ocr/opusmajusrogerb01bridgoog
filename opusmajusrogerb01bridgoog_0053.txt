with the science ol man3 they had to sace the difficolt and
urgent problems connected with the spiritual government oi
mankind. Their philosophy, like his, dealt with real things.
And il theirs was less positive, less lree from metaphysical
figurem, it is only that the complications os human nature
were less adapted lor positive treatment than the physical
phenomena to which Bacon devoted so large a share ol his
attention.
’ But in contrast with these three great schoolmen stand the
weavers ol word-systems, like Alexander of Hales, Henry os
Ghent, and Duns ScotuS‚ wasting their own and other men’s
time and energy in defining, dividing, and refining with infinite
ingenuity‚ and with such result as when children build sand-
castles on the shore. With such men it may have been
ncedlul to fight, yet fighting was but bearing the air. Ol

ln all Bacon’s discussion ol scholastic problems, the solution
he reached was ol a kind to favour the falling off os the meta-
physical husk, and to bring to light the real and positive
problem which lay beneath it. His scholastic theories are

to the master himself. anpily lor Bacon's peace ol mind, he did not live to
witness the triumphal career ol the Doctor Subtilis. Ol flaureau's carelul
appreciation ol his work the final words maybe quoted: ‘Cette philosophie
n'explique pas la nature, elle l'invente3 substituant l'ordre retionnel lt l'ordre
