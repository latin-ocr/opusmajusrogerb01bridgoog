Speaking ol the parts known to us, Ptolemy and others have dis·
tinguished seven clrinata-marking them hythe increasing length
os the longest day. The position oi each place referred to is defined
hythe intersection ol the line of latitude and longitude belonging
to it. The annes, or climata, oi Ptolemy are marked according to the
increase oi a quarter oi an hour in the length oi the longest day up
to the sixty-first degree of latitude; thence to the sirm-fourth degree,
hy halt au hour's increase; thenoe to the sixty-sixth by one hour’s
increase. Beyond this point we come to the region where in the
summer season the sun is always abovethe horizon, in winter always
henemh it. Here the divisione must he marked according as the ·
longest dayis one mouth, or two or three, up to six. As to longi·
tude, it should be measured not from any arbitrary point, hut iro'rn
the true east and west on the equator. The neglect oi this pre·
cantion has led to much conlusion in the rables os Toledo; and
generally a iar more accurate determination ol the latitudo and longi·
tude oi towns and states is needed, such as can only be instituted by
apostolical, imperial, or at least regal authority. . . . 294-801

interpretation oi Scripture, the propagation oi the saith, and the wel-
tare of commonwealths. Missionaries in particular should know the
distribution oi the various religione oi the world; where the lost
tribes os Judea are to be looked sor, where the incursione oi Anti·
christ are most to be dreaded. Our knowledge oi these matters,
derived from Pliny, Ptolemy and other writers ot antiquity, has been ..-

Capricorn the same phenomenon occurs ior each place twice in the
year. And we have knowledge ol regions south oi the tropicos
Capricom where the noonday shadow is always to the south. And ·
though in these last the sun approaches so nearly at our winter time, ·
and recedes so lar at our summer time, as to involve great extremities
of heat and cold, yet these evils may he lessened by the configuration
oi mountain and plain, so that the region is habitable, as we know
