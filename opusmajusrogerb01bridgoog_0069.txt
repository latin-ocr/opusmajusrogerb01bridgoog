unity and tlre correlation ol the sciences. ln passing lrom
Mathematics to the direct study ol Nature, he found a con-
necting link in the imaginary science ol Astrology, which
he studied zealously. That the fixed stars and the planets
exerciseda poweriul influence on all earthly things and not
least on man3 that the caresul observation ol their position* ·
at the moment os birth would do much to reveal the· hidden
springs ol character, and make it possible to form a iorecast
ol the ensuing lile, that the influences radiating lrom them
acted with greater or less potency according as the course oi
the rays was perpendicular or oblique, and thatin this way
an explanation could bc given ol climate, temperament, and
ol the thousand complex chances and changes ol mortal life,
was a belief firmly held by Bacon, and it operated powerfully
over his whole view of man's position in the world. He has
been much reproached lor holding it; and it has been supposed
to be an explanation, is not an excuse, lor the disastrous
repression exercised over him by his superiors, and for the

popular discredit attaching to his name.
But this would be an entire misconception ol the beliess

current in Bacon’s time. The influence ol the stars over
human lile was a belief almost universally held by all instructed
men from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century; and
abundant traces of it are,visible throughout the seventeenth,
not to speak ol still later times. The Divina Commedia is full
ol it. Beatrice, admonishing Dante at her first meeting with
· him in the Earthly Paradise, speaks of the rich endowment
with which he came into the world,

‘Per ovra delle ruore magne,
Che drizzan ciascun seme ad alcun fine,
Secondo che le stelle son compagne¹.'

¹ Purgat. xxx. 109-11. Even more significant is the passage, Pamd. viii.
127 3²¹ ‘Lu circular natura, ch¹ ἐ suggello
Alla cera morial, sa ben sua arte
hle non distingue l'un dall’ altro ostello.
Quinci addivien ch’ Esah si diparte
Per seme da Jacdb, e vien Quirino
Da si vil padre che si rende a Marte!
