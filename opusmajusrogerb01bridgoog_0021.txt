xviii PREFACE.

Principale projected by Bacon, but only in part

executed. On these points, and on the bibliography
' of Bacon generally, Mt. Little's (ἱνα) Friars in Oxford
is of great value. Other works consulted will be
noted as reference is made to them. Attention, how·
ever, may be specially called to Govi's recent edition
of the Latin translation of Ptolemy's Oplica, so fre·
quently used by Bacon (Tutin, 1885), a publication
of the greatest value for the history of science; and
to Heiberg's edition of Euclid's Optz'ca (vol. vii. of
his edition of Euclid‚ Leipsic‚ 1895). Wuestenfeld's
Gescln'chte der Arabz'sclzen A erate (Gottingen, 1840),
and Cantor's Gesclzz'clzte der M athemalz'k (Leipsic‚ 1880-
1892), throw light on the mediaeval men of science,
Eastern or Western, mentioned by Bacon. Haureau's
Hz'sloz'rc de la Philosophia Scolastique (Paris, 1872)
deliaca, with some acerbity, Bacon’s position among
the schoolmen. Jourdain's Reciercltes crz'tiques sur
les traductz'ons latz'nes d'Arislote (nouvelle edit„ 1843)
contain indispensable information as to the translators
of whose shortcomings Bacon so often complains,

For the geographical section of the work, in addition
to the classical works of Yule and Bunbmy, frequent
reference is made to the complete version of the travels
of Rubruquis and Carpini, published by the Paris
Geographical Society, in the fourth volume of their
Rccneil de Voynges etde Mlmoires (18 39).

As Seneca occupies so large a place in the seventh
section of the Opus Mujus, it may be mentioned that
the edition used for this work is that of Haase (Leipsic‚
1887). As to Aristotle, the references are to Didot's
edition (Paris, 1848-1873).
