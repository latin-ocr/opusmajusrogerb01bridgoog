convergence os rays. For such convergence the curvature
must be other than spherical‚ it must be that produced by the
rotation ol a conic section.

Bacon, moreover, is distinguished from the Arabian optical
writers, and lrom other investigators ol his own time, by his
sedulous endeavours to turn the discovery ol the laws ol re-
flexion and refraction to practical account. N either in Alhazen
nor in Vitello is there any attempt to construet instruments
lor the purpose of increasing the power os vision. With Bacon
this object was always held steadily in view. Of the simple
microscope he had a perfectly clear conception. His scientitic
imagination played lreely with the possibilities of bringing
distant objects near, and oi indefinitely magnilying minute
objects, by giving suitable directions to refracted rays, and by
the use of appropriate media. lt would be, however, an entire
exaggeration oi his achievements to speak of him as the
inventor ol the telescope. No evidence is forthcoming lor his
having effected the simple combination ol two convex lenses,
or oia convex with a concave lens, on which the power ol
telescopic vision depends. All that can be claimed for him
' is that he was the first definitely and explicitly to bring the
problem sorward, leaving it for alter generations to solve. In
truth, his conception oi an optical image, as constructed by the
assemblage ol loci of rays proceeding from each point of the
object magnified, though in the main correct, was not always
clearly grasped. Ol the distinction between virtual and real
images‚ his notion was entirely in delault.

Nor, again, had Bacon a clear conception os the conditions oi
distinct vision. He examined to much better purpose than
Alhazen had done the structores ol the eye ; and he was aware
oi the refraction produced by the curved 'suriace oi the comea,
and by the doubly convex crystallina lens. But what he
lailed to grasp ¹ was the necessity os a clear image ol the object
defined on the retina3 that image being produced by the
locussing on the retina oi rays proceeding lrom each point of

the object. The phenomena ol accommodatiori, produced by
the action ol the ciliary nruscle‚ which, by altering the curva-
