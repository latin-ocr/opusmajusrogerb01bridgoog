CHAPTER 1.

Leaving method, and passing to the objects ol study, we findit
impossible to make progress without mathematics. The number and
motions of the heavens, planetary motions, eclipses obviously require
this science. And things terrestrial no less, sinoe they are governed
by things celestial. The sun, acting on the surrounding medium,
dill'uses light. This may be taken as a type ol the propagation, or
multiplication‚ ol species, or forces, by other agents. Let us consider
how it takes place ......... llll-ill

CHAPTER 11.

Rays passing from ararer medium to a denser, il' they impinge upon
the latter perpendicularly‚ pursue a rectilinear course. Otherwise
they are refracted, i. e. diverted towards the perpendicular drawn to the
surlace ol contact. ln passing srom denser to rarer they are diverted
away from this perpendicular. Hence il the denset bodybe spherical,
the solar rays passing through it converge at a given point beyond it.
The convergence ol many rays produces heat ll the second medium
is so dense that the ‘speeies’ cannot pass through, or at least that its
transit cannot be appreciated by human vision, it is reflected. ll
the ray falls perpendicular to this medium, reflexion is in the reverse

= direction of incidence. ll otherwise, the angle of reflexion is equal to
the angle ol incidente. By concave reflectors solar rays may be
concentrated tf the reflector is spherical, those rays will be locussed
which impinge on points in it corresponding to a circle placed at
right angles with its axis. But reflectors can be devised ol such form
that all the rays shall lall on the reflecting surlace at equal angles,
and thus be reflected to the same locus. We have further to consider
the diffusion ol light impinging on objects not directly from the sun
but indirectly. Constant exposure to direct rays would be destructive.
Lnstly, we have to consider the effect ol light on the nerves ol vision,
when there is no question ol its following any rectilinear course,
its path being modilied by the vital principle . . . 111-117
