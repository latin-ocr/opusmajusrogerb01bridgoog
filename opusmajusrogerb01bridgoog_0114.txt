By the ioregoing principles and others akin to them, which ior
want of space are here omitted, all natural actions are to be ex-
plained. Α few illustrations may be given. The planets receive
their light from the sun. Hence when the earth is between the sun
and moon, the moon is eclipsed by the earth's shadow. The cone
ol this shadow not reaching however to the other planets, these are
not eclipsed. Again, that the eye and the stars can mutually transmit
their emanatione through the media of the planetary orbits, proves
these media to be of great rarity, to be invisible, and non-luminous.
The sphere os fire also is neither luminous nor visible. A planet
differs from the sphere in which it moves by greater condensation of
celestial substance3 hence its luminosity. This, though ultimately
derived lrom the sun, is not due to the sun’s reflected rays. The
diffusion of moonlight proves the moon to have independent
luminosity. Owing to the magnitude of the sun being 170 times
greater than that oi the moon, much more than halr' oi the earth is
illuminated by· the sun; and the same is the case with the moon and
planets. Other affections oi the moon’s light depend on her varying
conjunctions with planets and with constellations . . . 127-130

The same principles may be applied to disproye the alleged
simplicity of cosmic structure. Α staron the meridian is seen to be
further from the pole than at its rising. ln the latter position ‘s
refraction displaces it. This shows the world to consist os distinct
substances ol varying density; ior a ray would not be refracted while
passing through the same substance, even though its parts should be
ol different density ......... lto-132

CHAPTER lll.

Hence it is that the temperaturesoi the various eones are explained
Beneath the poles the eones oi rays are prolonged, and therefore
ieeble3 capable only oi raising vapours from the earth and sea, so
that the air os those climates is heavy and cold, and uniit for living
things. Nevertheless, owing to the length oi the days and of the
twilight in summer, the sun being never iar distant, there may be
places in those regions, favoured by the position and inclination oi
certain mountains, where the rays are so reflected that the climate is
temperate ........... lta-135
