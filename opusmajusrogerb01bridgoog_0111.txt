cii ANALYSIS OF THE ‘OPUS MAJUSJ

CHAPTER ll.

There is high authority lor this estimate of mathematice. ln the
study ot divine things and also ol man's social lite Boethius and ⁶
Ptolemy show that it is of great service. The various modes oi
proportion have their analogue in civil polity. Itis needed both in
grammar and logie, as Alpharabius and Cassiodorus have shown.
For prosody depends entirely on arithmetical relations. Logic, on
its practical side, has the same purpose as poetic and rhetoric, which
depend on harmony. F urther, the subject-matter ol logie is in·
timately connected with mathematic. This is obvious in the
Categories oi quantity, ot' time, and ol place. ln the Categoryof
quality much belongs to the mathematical domain, as eg. geo·
metrical lorm. The same may be said oi the Category ol relation
Spiritual substances can only be known through the medium oi
corporal: and the first step to the knowledge ol body is the study
oi the heavenly bodies. The dependente os astronomy on mathe-
matics is obvious ..... · ..... tta-103

C HAPTER lll.

We reach the same conclusion by reasoning. (a) ln all other
scientes we use mathematical examples, because they illustrate the
point without cont'usingcomplications3 eg. in explaining the differenoe
between augmentation and change, we add a gnomon to a rectangle,
augmenting its magnitude without changing its shape. (h Mathe·
matical knowledge is innate in us and only needs drawing out, as
Cicero explains, Quaest. Tusc. book i. (cl Mathematical truths
⁸ are discovered prior to others. (d) They are simplet ot compre·
hension than others. (e) Students attain them who are incapahle
of proceeding further. (s) We see the same thing with children,
who easily appreciate the simple arithmetical relations on which
music depends. ( g) We acquire our knowledge ol things known to
ourselves more easily than of things known to nature (ie. intrinsi-
cally simpler; as, lot instance, the truths ol theology). But mathe-
maticshave the doublecharacterol beingboth relativelyand absolutely
simplet. (h) ln mathematice demonsuation is more complete:
its cogency has the soree ol necessity, which is not the case
either in physics‚ in metaphysic, in ethic. (il ln other sciences
the uncertainty ol the premisses involves uncertainty in the con-
clusion. These principles require verification by some science more
perfect than themselves: i. e. by mathematice. (kl Finally, the
subject-matter ol mathematics is more directly cognizable hy our
senses. lt deals with quantity, which lies at the root ol all lrnow·
ledge. The simplest process of intellect implies continuous quantity,
