must observe too in what house each planet may be; mr on this

the whole complexion ol the year may largely depend. On the

ioregoing data we form our judgements oi events past, present, and

future. As a first step to this we must form accurate astronomical

tables exhibiting the position oi the benvenlybodies at any given

date. Comparing these positions with the political events ol such

a date, we obtain methods ior lorecasting future events Our best

authorities on this subject are Albnmazar,Ptole1ny, Haly, and tbe

Hebrew astrologers A work oi Aristotle on celestini impressions

Next comes the question, How lar can this knowledge guide our

actioni We cannot do away with the force resulting from any

special position os the stars: but we can modiiyourown action so'

as not to be adversely affected by it. ll we know that great cold

is coming, we can make provision against cold. Similarly the

trained astronomer will provide against pestilence, or any other

calamity which he sees impending. *Ol such modifying influences

Moses and Solonion have given examples recorded by josephus.

Another instance is the advice given lby Aristode to Alexander as

and thus change their morals. . . . . . -. .. utenti
What deters studente from the examination oi this subject is leat

of the imputation of magio. Doubtless astrology may be *turned to

abad account; but so may the most useful ol tools. Men do not

a strange force in certain words, uttered -with lull consciousness
ul their meaning, which may cooperate with stellar forces. This
ιοο has been abused ior purposes ol magic and witchcralt, and dis·
credit has been thrown on such agencies, which yet in wisc hands
are usciul. Like the stars, the human seul, whioh is nobler than
they, emits forces t'rom itself, which acting in harmony with stellar
forces may pmduce great results: The objection osten made that.
when the stars act on any object, they must act equally on other
objects in the same horizon, isos no account: ior no two objects are
in the same horizon . . .. .. . -. . .. . 394398
Fascination, again, is a word with a bad sound. Yet important
truth is contained in it. lnlluences radiate lrom certain persons,
which may be good or bad, and which may be concentrated by
a strong will and directed to a special object. Words used with this
concentrated purpose may have great power. The exercise ot'
miraculous power by the saints has been accompanied by words
We need knowledge oi all these forces to resist the coming power
