cxii ANALYSIS OF THE ‘OPUS MAJUS.'

star a degree higher in the slry? We shall find the result to be
fifty-six miles, 2984& cubits. From the diameter of the earth we
obtain its circumference and its surface. The distance of the heavenly
bodies 1nay be measured in semidiameters of the earth=3,250 miles.

Alfraganus estimates the distance of the starry sphere to be 20,110
semidiameters; which gives the diameter of this sphere as
13o,715,ooo miles. From this we can calculate the circumference
and surface The longest distance of Satum is tbe semidiameter of
this sphere, or 65,357,5oo miles, of Jupiter 46,816,250 miles, of Mars
28,847,ooo miles, of the Sun 3,965,0oo miles, of Venus 3,640,ooo miles,
of Mercury 542,750 miles, of the Moon ao8,541} miles3 the shorter
distance of the preceding planet being always equal to the longer
distance of the succeeding. As to the ninth and the tenth heaven we
bavenoscientilicknowledge. As to theheight of the atmospbere there
is great uncertainty. For measuring the apparent diameters of the
Sun and the Moon recourse has been to water-clocks; the number
of drops issuing from the beginning to the end of the Sun's rising
have been compared with the number issuing during a revolution
of the heavens. But there are more accurate methods by astrolabes
or quadrants. From these, and from observations of eclipses, the
moon’s diameter is estintated at 1⁶⁷ of the Earth's diameter. The
Eanh is therefbre about 31} as large as the moon. Similarly the
Sun will be found to be 170 times as large as the Earth Mercury is
„⁴335 of the Earth. ln a similar way the relative magnitude of
the other planets as compared with the Earth may be determined.
The fixed stars are noea in number, and are divided into six groups
according to this magnitude. Those of the first magnitude are 107
times as large as the Eartb3 of the second, ninety times the Earth’s
magnitude: of the third, seventy-two times, of the fourth, fifty-four
times, of the fifth, thirty-six times, of the sixth‚ eighteen times. But
besides these there are infinite numbers of other stars whose
magnitude cannot be determined ...... 219-236
Seventh head. Music. 'l'he theologian should beacquainted with
the theory, if not with the practice, of vocal and instrumental music.
Music covers the whole ground of recitation, punctuation, accent,
things necessary for prose as well as poetry. Of instruments again
many are spoken of in Scriptura, and each has a spiritual as well as
literal meaning. Nor must dancing, which may be called visible
music, be forgotten ......... 236-238
We have now to consider certain objections that have been raised
with regard to mathematical science. Mathematic has been con·
founded with magic, and put on the same level as fortune-telling,
witch·craft, and the preparation of charms and incantations lt has
been credited with the doctrine that human actions are absolutely
