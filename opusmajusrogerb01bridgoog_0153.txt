must be situated at the extremity ol that course, whether it has been
straight or angular‚ in order to receive the impression. lt follows
that the radiation produces no durable effect on the reflecting ,
suriace. From this again it follows that the moon and the stars
sbine with their own light, not with light reflected from the sun:
otherwise we should see the sun’s image reflected in them. Neither,

again, is a comet the reflexion ol solar light from the surtaoe of
a star. The case of the rainbow will be considered afterwards. The

position in which we judge the reflected object to be is, in plane
mirrors, at the intersection behind the mirror oi the prolongation of
the reflected ray with that os the perpendicular let fall on the mirror
from the object. But in mirrors other than plane tbe apparent
position varies very greatly ....... 132-134

CHAPTER lll.

There are seven lrinds os mirrors‚ spherical, conical‚ cylindrical‚
or plane. Ol the first three classes each may be eitber convex or
concave. Geometrical prool is given that in plane mirrors the image
and the object appear equidistant irum the plane of the mirror on
opposite sides. Nothing really takes place either in tbe mirror or
behind it. The ell'ect produced is a mental impression caused by ,
the peculiar path taken hythe radiation from the object. ln spheri-
cal convex mirrors, the intersection oi the visual ray with a line
drawn from the object to the centre of the sphere fixes tbe apparent
position ol the object. This intersection may be beyond the mirror,
in the mirror, oron the same side as the object. Usually the image
appears less than the reality, because the rays come from a smaller
area than in the case ol the plane mirror: in the spherical most of
them are dispersed The image is erect but distorted: the onter
rays of the cone touching points more distant lrom the eye than the
median rays. Only when the image oi a right line crosses the centre
ol the sphere is that image rectilinear. Moreover, in convex mirrors
the image is nearer to the mirror than the object is‚· because tbe inter·
section ol the visual ray with the perpendicular occurs sooner in
spherical than in plane mirrors. In cylindrical mirrors the errors

are even greater than in spherical, except in the one case where
a line in the object is equidistant from the axis of the cylinder.

Only il this line has any hreadth, its transverse magnitude will be

distorted. ln conver conical mirrors the same errors occur as in
convex spherical .......... 134-137

CHAPTER IV.

The greatest illusions are those that occur in concave mirrors, both
as rothe sire ol the image, and the number oi its repetitions; some
