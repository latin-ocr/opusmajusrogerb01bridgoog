354 OPERIS MAJORIS PARS QUARTA.

et tota Syria, ut dictumest. Sed in confinio Mediae et
' Parthiae est porta ferrea Alexandri, quae est civitas denomi-
nata a portis, et illae portae dicuntur Caspiae ¹, non Caucasiae,
ut dicit Plinius, Nam aliae sunt portae Caucasi, ut postea
dicetur, quia in littore maris Caspii sunt hae portae. Est enim
mare quoddam, quod fit ex concursu maximorum fluminum
venientum ab aquilone, et Caspium vocatur, atque Hyrcani·
cum secundum Plinium. Nam Caspii ,et Hyrcani super
littora illius maris inhabitant3 non igitur est hoc mare
veniens ab oceano², ut Isidorus et Plinius, et omnes auctores
occidentales scribunt. In hoc enim casu non habuerunt
experientiam certam per se nec per alios, sed ex rumore
scripserunt. ln libris autem de moribus Tartarorum, ut
per fide dignos qui inillis regionibus fuerunt patet, quod
hoc mare fit ex concursu fluminum, et est mare satis magnum.

² This pass is ‘still traversed by the most frequented route from Teheran to
hleshed and Herat. The identity oi this pass with the one now known as the
Sirdar pass, between Veramin and Kishlak in Khowar, has been fully established
by modern travellers! Bunbury, Aac. Geog. vol. i. p. 477.

The pass called by Bacon Caucasian, and carehrlly distinguished by him from
the Sirdar pass (cs. p. 364), is described by Marco Polo (i. ch 4) when speaking
oi Georgia. ‘This is the country beyond which Alexander could not passwhen
he wished to penetrate to the region os the Tenent, because that the defile was
so narrow and perilous, the sea lying ou the one hand and on the other losty
mountains impassable to horsemen. Alexander caused a very strong tower to
be built there tn prevent the people beyond from passing to attack him, and
this got the name oi the Iron Gate. This is the place that the book ns Alexander
speaks os when it tells us how he shut up the Tartara between two mountains3
not that they were really Tartara, however, forthere were no Tartara in those
days; but they consisted oi a race oi people called Comanians and many
besidea’ ‘This' says Yule, in his note on this passage, ‘refers to the Pass ni
Derbend. still called in Turlrish Demir Kspi or the Iron Gate, and to the ancient
wall that runs from the Castle ol Derbend along the ridges ni Caucasus, called
in the East Saddidskendr, the Rampart os Alexander. Bayer thinks the wall
was built originally by one ol the Antiochi, and renewed by the Sassauim
Kobad or his son Naoshirvan!

The mediaeval legend, bearing the name ol Callisthenes, asto the inprison-
ment by Alexander oi twenty-two wild tribes behind those gates, Gog and
Magog among them, is repeated by Aethicus, and by many other mediaeval
writers.

² Thisia oue oi the most important corrections made iu the geography oi
Asia by Bacon, in consequence oi the attention paid by him to the reporta oi
the two Franciscan missionaries, Rubruquis and Carpini. Previously to their
travels the Caspian had usually, though not always, been held to be a guli
communicating with the Scythic, or Arctie, ocean.
