the diameter which forms the axis of the mirror3 those from the
circumference of any circle drawn on the minor in aplane perpen-
dicular to the axis will meet in a point. The smaller the circle the
greater will be the distance ο1 the point oi convergeuce from the
mirror; and conversely. (Such circles are, oi course, merely
imaginary; they merely indicate a series ol points similarly placed

with regard to the axis) ........ rat-490
But another form ο1 concave mirror has been devised in which the
curvature is such that all the rays shall converge to a single point.
ffhis cannot be explained here, but it may be mentioned that the

CHAPTER 11111.
Rays from the object proceed equally in all directions, as radii

lrom the centre ol a sphere. lt is objected thatrays passing through .
an angular orifice illuminate an angular not a circular space. But
this depende on the distance ο1 the illuminated surlace from the
orifice. 11 the distance be sufficient, the illuminated suriace is cir·
cular. The smaller the orifice, the less the distance required to
obtain this result. Much depends also on the strength os the rays3
those os the sun at noonday, being stronger, produce the result more
readily than the leebler rays of morning light. For the same reason,
at noon a smaller portion of the solar suriacesvill effect the result thau
in the moming3 in the latter case t'he illumination not being circular,
much will be dispersed and lost. That the shape of a flame is not
spherical but conical, is due to the ascending force of the particles.
ln the sphere oi fire. where there is no such force, the lire assumes i'ts
natural (spherical) shape. The centre of the illuminated suriace is
most strongly illuminated3 the surrounding parts being illuminated
by intersecting mys, and therefore more feebly. Since all regular
figures can be inscribed in a circle, the spherical form os emission of
rays includes all the others, and especially the conical . . 491-494

CHAPTER IX.

Species proceed from every point in the agent, not from one only.
lVe see this in the caseos shadows. 11 an illuminated body be less
than the illuminating‚ the shadow formed is conical and limited; it
the two are equal, it is cylindrical and unlimited. ll the illuminated
body be greater, the shadow is divergent and unlimited. We are
supposing that the agent is homogeneous. 11 it be heterogeneous‚
we must consider each homogeneous part separately. ln dealing
with the cone ο1 rays proceeding srorn any point, we have to remember
that it is the axis ο1 the cone, directed vertically to the sunace acted
