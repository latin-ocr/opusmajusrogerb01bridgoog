PROPAGA TION OF F ORCE lxv

stellar influences towards the central point of a closed universe
should have arisen, but that it should so long and so pcr-
sistently have survived the discovery that the universe was not

closed but boundless. That Francis Bacon, who rejected or -

doubted the Copernican theory, should have retained his belies
in astrology is not surprising. But we should have expected
that with men like Kepler and Campanella, it would have
vanished like the morning mist. Yet it was not s0.

Bacon’s views of stellar influences must be taken in con·
nexion with his speculations as to the transmissione oi force
through space. These are set forth briefly in the second and
third Distinctions of the fourth part oi the Opus Majus3 and
more in detail in the special treatise De Multiplicatione
Specierum, which in this edition is given asan appendix. ”

‘Species' is the word chosen by Bacon to express the
emanation of force which he conceives to be continually pro·
ceeding from every bodily object in all directions. Body of
every kind is endowed with force which indeed is identical
with its substance or essence. The first result of this force,
resembling it in character, is its species, otherwise called
likeness, or image, or intention, or impression ln. other
words, body isa centre of activity or force radiating in every
direction. Species is the first result os this soree, the ray
proceeding irom the body. Tracing back this doctrine to its
origin. we find it expounded in the fourth book oi Lucretius,
in Diogenes Laertius' account ol the system ol Epicurus, and
in the traces that remain to us oi older philosophers, notably
of Democritus. Aristotle, in his short treatise on Divination
by dreams, alludes to the theory oi Democritus that ‹itote-
and ἀπόρροιαι were continually emitted from objects which in
the stillness of the night were capable of affecting the sleeper.
By Epicurus, in his letter to Herodotus quoted in his biography
by Diogenes Laertius, the theory is more sully detailed. ‘There
are, moulds,’ he says, ‘corresponding to all solid bodies pre-
serving the same shape and arrangement as these bodies
