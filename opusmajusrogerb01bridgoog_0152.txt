CHAPTER v111.

We may now sum up the results ot' our study ol direct vision. We
have spoken ol vision as operating by sensation, hy recollection, and
by a syllogistic process. li these two last are to be interpreted as in
the schools they would imply the intervention oi Reason. But itis
evident that brutes have the power of recogniring and distinguishing
both universals and particulars. A dog recogniaes a particular man,
and also recognizes men in general irum dogS, trees or other objects.
Theresore this faculty must be a iunction oi sensitive lile, and cannot
imply reason in the strict sense oi that word. Further, animals pass
through a train oi mental praeesses analogous to syllogistic reasoning‚
though they cannot put it into a logical ligure Tbey have a store-
house os mental impressions. They can generalize‚ and they cau
draw conclusions3 though they are not oonscious oi doing so, and
cannot givean account ol what is passing within them . . 126-129

CHAPTER 1.

lt is vunnecessary to repeat what has been already said of the
structure ol the eye and the iunctions ol sensation. Bodies that
inrpede the passage oi visual radiations may he either wholly
opaque, os a stone wall; or partially opaque, as water, glass‚
crystal. Opaque bodies do not destroy the radiation: they merely
· alter its path. Au opeque body may be rough or smooth. When
the suriace is rough, the parts being unsymmetrical scatter the
radiations irregularly‚ and there is no image. With smooth surlaces
the parts all act alilre, and the radiation oomes back to the eye
uninjured, though t'eebler than in direct vision. Proot' is subjoined
of the equality ol the angles ol incidence and reflexion, and this prooi
will hold, whether the suriace be plane or spherical: lor the ray may

be regarded as falling on the tangent plane . . . ‚130-132

The mirror contains nothing. What is seen is the real object,
