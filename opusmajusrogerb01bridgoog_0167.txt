clviii ANALYSIS OF THE ‘OPUS rmus!

CHAPTER Vl.

vor„ ιι. eacus

Having spoken of the vices connected with pleasure and pros-
perity, we pass to the discomfiture of the soul in adversity by Anger.
ln resisting anger, the first step is to see itas it really is, with all its
disastrous consequences to spiritual and temporal welfare. By nature
man is mild and gentle, inclined to help his fellow-man. Giving way
to anger he exhibits the physical symptoms of wild beasts, distortion
of the countenance, agitation of the limbs,swelling of the veins,foarning
at the mouth, gnashing of the teeth, spasm of the breath. The effect
on the rational faculties is no less disturbing. It has osten utterly
destroyed the mental balance, and the temporary insanity caused by
it has become permanent. N ο less pernicious is its effect on practical
conduct. All the virtues are inter-connected, so that the loss of one
involves injury to the rest. Anger is destructive to the noblest
virtues, such as clemency‚ magnanimity, pity, natural affection, trau·
quillity and joy. Clemency is specially characteristic of man, and to
the rulers of men it is peculiarly appropriate. It may be noted that
among bees the king alone is without a sting. The noblest of the
Roman emperors have been distinguished for this virtue. Closely
connected with it is the virtue of magnanimity, which leads its
possessor to forgive injuries‚ and to be unconscious of their existence.
But this state of mind is wholly incompatible with anger. As that
part of the heavens which ls nearest the stars is free from clouds, so
is the magnanimous spirit free from the disturbing intluences of
anger. The swelling and exaltation of spirit which anger produces
is no sign of vital energy, but rather of morbid flatulence and weak·
ness. Besides magnanimity, other virtues are impaired by auger, as
mercy, patience, aud joy. Mercy is that which lifts man nearest to the
level of God. Nothing is nobler than forgiveness and forbearance, and
readiness to find extenuating circumstances in every offence, remem-
bering how prone we are to give offence ourselves To avenge
ourselves on brute auimals is what no one thinks of: and should we
he less indulgent to men than to bruteri Readiness to forgive a
personal injury is stimulated by cultivating indulgent feelings towards
human nature. But such a state of mind as this is wholly incoru-
patible with anger. The destructive effecta of Anger on such virtues
as Piety and Peace are too obvious to dwell upon . . . 275-288

ln addition to these things, anger makes a man reckless of his own
life and that of his friends, as there are many signal examples in
history to show. Under its influence a man become careless of
wealth or reputation, and is led to blasphemous rebellion against
