¹‹trtiv ANALYSIS OF THE ‘OPUS Malus:

But there is another and more essentia! meaning ol the word
House. 1t we divide the ecliptic into twelve parts, and‘ through the
divisions conduct circles intersecting at the poles ol the ecliptic,
the regions between any two oi these circles is in the true sense
a House; hearing the name os its zodiacal sign. The principal
House oi each planet is that in which it was created Leo is the·
House oi the Sun, Capricorn ot' Saturn, Sagittarius oi Jupiter, Virgo '²
oi Mercury. There are certain signs ior each planet which are
called its Exaltation; ior the Sun Aries, ior Satum Libra, ior Jupiter
Cancer, lor Mars Capricorn, servanus Pisces, for Mercury Virgo.
The signs are divided into four groups: three, Aries, 1.eo,Sagittarius,
are hot and dry: three, Taurus, Virgo, and Capricom, are cold
and dry: three, Gemini, Libra, Aquarius, are hot and moist: three,
Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces, 'are cold· and moist. A planet being
in any of the groups to which its House belongs is said to be in its ·
Triplicity. We have further to consider Boundan'es and Aspccts.
With regard to Boundariea they vary ior each planet and ior each
sign. With regard to Aspects, each sign is divided into three equal
portioris ol ten degrees, and a portion is assigned to euch planet in
sequence ........... 258-261
lt will appear in the result that Mercury has maniiold and strong
connexions with the sign ot Virgo. Aa Mercury is connected with
Christian saith, so is the Mean, with its irregular motions, connected ·
with the conuption oi that saith. The conjunctione of the planets,
and especially those ol Jupiter and Saturn, throw light on important
epocha ot history. These are oi three kinds, occurring respectively
in periodsoi ao,oi 240, and oi 9⁶0 years. Judging irum what took
place at previous periods, it may be inserted that the Mahometan
saith will not be oi much longer duration. There yet remaius the
period oi Antichrise, on the date oi which study oi these astronomical
periods may throw light ........ aul-aua
Α second application oi mathematice to the service oi the Church
is the correction os the Calendar. The Julian Calendar lixed the
length oi the year at 365} days. Hence the arrangement oi an
additional day every fourth year. But this estimato is known to be
too great by the fh, part oi a day. Therelore in every 130 years
there isanaccumulated errorot' one day ..... uuo-271
Again‚ it has been assumed that the equinoxes and solstices
occurred on lixed days. These days in the beginning of the Church
were iixed thus: the winter solstice ou December 25, the vernal
equinox on March 25, the summer solstioe on June 24, the autumnal
equinox on September 24. subsequently the vernal equinox was
transposed to March 21. Hence the earliest Easter, being the drst
Sunday aiter the full moon suooeeding to the vernal equinos, vas
