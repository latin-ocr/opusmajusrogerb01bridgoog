OPTICS. lxix

is common to all things, and thus there is no substance on
which the action· involved in the passage ol a ray may not
produce a change. Thus it is that rays ol heat and sound
penetrate through the walls os a vessel of gold or brass. lt
is said by Boetius that a lynx’s eye will pierce through thick
walls. In this case the wall would be permeable to visual
rays. ln any case there are many dense bodies which
altogether intersere with the visual and other senses oi man,
so that rays cannot pass with such energy as to produce an
effect on human sense, and yet nevertheless rays do really
pasS, though without our being aware os it.'¹ Recent dis·
coveries have given significante to this remarkable passage; ’

generations, must have seerned in the highest degree lan·

The most striking illustration oi laws governing the transit
ol iorce through space was obviously to be looked ior in the
science ol Optics (perspectiva). The filth section ol the Opus
Majus‚ amounting to about one-fifth os the whole, is devoted

to this science3 and much supplemental matter is added in
the treatise De Multiplicatzbne Specierum. Optics had been

studied by the Greeks to much purpose. The works ol Euclid,
Theon, and Ptolemy were translated into Arabio and were
carefully studied by Arabian men os science, notably by Aba
‘All al Hasan ibn al Hasan ibn Alhaitam, better known to
Occidentals under the name ol Alhazen. Their principal
results are embodied in Bacon’s work.

Euclid, or the author passing under his name¹, was aware
that light proceeded in straight lines, and that visual rays were
reflected from plane mirrors in such a way that the angles
