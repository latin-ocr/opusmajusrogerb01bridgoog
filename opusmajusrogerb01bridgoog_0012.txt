evolution os religious truth was proceeding in Judaea‚
Greece became the scene os the growth of philosophy.
Both were alike ordained in God's providence. In our
own times, as in those of antiquity, the study of both
should be carried on continuously. But sor this
purpose it was essentia] that the wisdom of the ancients
should be studied in the language in which it was
originally set forth. To limit students to Latin trans-
lations is to ensure the multiplicatiora of error. Most
of these translations, especially those of the Bible and

tion of learning is the systematic study of at least three
languages besides Latin, namely‚ Hebrew, Greek, and
Arabic.

The second condition was the application of mathe-

world or in the Church. Mathematic is the ⁴ gateway
and the key to all other sciences' ; it raises the under-
standing to the plane at which knowledge can be
distinguished from ignoranee. &Vithout it other sciences
are unintelligible. lt reveals to us the motions of the

upon character; of the position of cities and os the
boundaries of nations whom it is the function of the
Catholic Church to bring within her pale, and to control
spiritually. With these subjects the fourth and fifth
sections os the Opus Majus are occupied; they form
the principal bulk of its contentS. But mathematical
