before the eye when we wish to see very distinctly. Eye-lashes help
in the same direction. ln fish'es which have none, the visoal force is
dispersed. So too it is that from the depth ol a well we are able to
see the stars The amount ol the aqoeoos humour in iront ol the
lens would also aflect vision Those who have little see further than
others, lor deep water, though transparent, yet is a bar to the nans·
mission ot' light. lt may be observed that old people hold objects
that they wish to examine further from the eye. The reason is that
their eyes aboond io molsture: and the object to be clearly visible
must be placed beyond the range ol that moisture . . . 83-86

CHAPTER 11.

Distinctness ol vision does not always accompany length oi vision.
lt depends on the sufficient siae ol the lens, on the purity ot all the
humours os the eye, and on the absence ol that degeneration οἱ the
cornea and the capsule ol the lens which comes with age, and which
involves the casting ol shadows. Why is it that some eyes see better
in the darlr than others? Absence ol moistore and extreme trans-
parency in the ocular structores condoce to this result; such eyes
are overpowered with light in the daytime, and see badly. F orther,
the eye has a certain amount ol independent luminosity; greater in
some men and animals than in others ...... 86-88

CHAPTER 111.

Douhle vision results srorn disturbances in ocular structores ln
the normal condition ol the eyes, the object seen appears single
ll the eyes are congenitally or lorcibly displaced, this unity os the
object is lost. Extremo heat or cold may produce this result; or
anger, infirmity, or drink. Duplicity oi vision may depend either
on displacement oi the vitreoos humour, or ol the nervous spirit pro·
ceeding from the hrain to the eye, or on dilatation or contraction
ol the uvea. ln some cases there may be an exudation covering a
portion ol the lens. Another cause ol duplicity has been suggested.
The radiations issuing lrom the eye may he so leeble as to be stopped
not merely by the object ol vision, bot by some one ol the radiations
lrom this object. lt is stated also that in some cases the eye has
had two pupils, though l have not myself seen this . . . 88-91

How is it that we see a cloud at a distance, whereas when close to
it, or immersed in it, we do not? The answer is that the radiatiooa
