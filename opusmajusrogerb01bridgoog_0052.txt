SCRIPTUM PRINCIPALE. xliii

duantur per materiam! (Cf. Aquinas, Summa Theol. i. quaest.
iii. cert. 2.) Aquinas was obliged, however, to add that this

materia must be ‘signata ἐ must be quantified. ‘Signatio ejus
est esse sub certis signationibus quae faciunt esse hic et nunc.’
This addition went sar to neutraiize the Thomist view os
Individuation; sor as his opponente at once rejoined, ‘What
determines quantity ii not form ?'

In opposition to Aquinas, Bonaventura maintained that
‘species est toturn esse individui? Substance consisting os
the union of matter and form, matter was unisorm in all: the
iorm was that which distinguished, individuaiized.

Bacon (‘ Commun Natur.' Pt. 11. Dist. ii. ch. 9), in opposition
to either view, maintained that the question was meaningless
and foolish. All substances, whether universal or singular,
have their own constitutive principles. Soul and body make
man. This soui and this body make this man. In the inten-
tion and procedure os nature, ‘this man’is prior to ‘man';
‘man’ comes in as something subsidiary, ‘extra essentiam
ejus, similis accidenti,' as the means oi comparison with other
individuals. There is no more reason ior inquiring what
causes individuation than sor inquiring what causes universality.
There is no answer to such a question, except that the Creator
makes everything as its nature requires. Iudividual matter
and form is made in one way: specific or generic matter and
form is made in another. ‘Stultitia magna est in hujusmodi
quaestione quam iaciunt de individuatione.'

111. Bneox's ‘Scnrrruu Pammenia!

The soregoing remarks, which it would be easy, but not, in
this place, justifiable to prolong, will illustrate Bacon’s position
as a schoolman, thoroughly versed in the teckm'quc oi scho-
lastic controversy. But he was a schoolman whom a long and
laborious study os the realitics os lise, whether in nature or in
man, had taught to distinguish things from words: solid facts
from subtle figments. He was not alone in this Albert and
Aquinas were solid thinkers like himself. Less versed in
natural science than Baton, they had more than he to do
