OPTICS. lxxi

Their knowledge of the subject is summed up in the work of

Alhazen‚ whose remarkable work, Thesaurus Opticae, written
perhaps in the eleventh century, was translated in the twelsth
into Latin3 as J0urdain thinks, by Gerard ol Cremona, the
translator ol Ptolemy’s Almagcst. Alhazen was the writer on
whom Roget Bacon principally relied; though he makes ire-
quent use ol the optical treatises ol Euclid, Ptolemy, Tideus,
and Alkindi.

Alhazen’s work is copious in the extreme3 in some parts
extremely tedious. lts value as a document in the history ol
science is, however, very great„ lt consists os seven books.
The first begins with a brief exposition ol the nature ol light
and colour, and proceeds to explain the anatomyof the organs
oi vision The second deals with the sunction of vision and
with the physiology ol perception. The third, with imper-
fectione and illusione incident to vision. The fourth, fifth, and
sixth are devoted to the subject of reflexion. Seven kinds os
mirrors are discussed‚ plane, spherical‚ cylindrical, and conical;
the convex and concave lorms os the three last being separately
considered. The multiplicatiori and position os the 'images
formed is treated with inordinate length, but with such
geometrical skill as to secure lor him an abiding place in the
history of pure, no less than os applied mathematics. ‘His
investigation,’ says Cantor (Gcsclriclrte der Mathemalik, vol. i.
p. 677), ‘ o the problem : ln a spherical concave mirror, to find
the point from which an object os given position will be
reflected to an eye of given position, is one which, analytically
handled, leads to an equation os the fourth degree’ Alhazen
solved it, as Govi remarks (Ptol. Opt. p. xix), by the use ol
an hyperbole.

The seventh book os the Thesaurus Opticae deals with re·
fraction. A very elaborate description is given os the instru-
ment for measuring it, part of which Bacon quotes. Moreover‚
an attempt is made to explain the cause ol refraction which is
substantially identical with Bacon’s‚ as may be seen by com-
parison os Alhazen vii. 8 with De Mult. Specierum‚ Part Il.
cap. 3. The apparatus for measuring the angle ol refraction,
which was more accurately designod than that of Ptolemy,
