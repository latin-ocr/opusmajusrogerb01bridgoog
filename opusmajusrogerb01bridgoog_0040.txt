 

BACON'S LIFE. xxxv

many of them mere displays of geometrical ingenuity, pre·
cisely those which aimed at the interpretation of nature, and
at the adaptation of the laws os luminous radiation to human
purposeS. He was aware of what was unknown to Ptolemy
and Alhazen‚ the concentration os parallel rays from reflecting
sursaces formed by revolutions of a conic section; though how
far he was indebted for this knowledge to Peter Peregrinus
or to Vitello cannot be stated with certainty. Os the magnify-
ing powers of convex lenses Bacon had a clear comprehension.
He imagined, and was within measurable distance of effecting,
the combination of lenses which was to bring far things near,
but which was not to be realized till the time of Galileo.

In 1614, four years aster the invention of the teloecope,
Combach, professor of philosophy in the University of Mar-
purg, published this great work of Bacon, ‘viri eminentissimi.'
It would be interesting to know whether the allusion in the
Novum Organum (lib. i. 80) to the work os an obscure monk
(‘ monachi alicujus in cellula’) has reference to this work. The
Cogitata et Visa was written before Combach’s edition was
published; but examples of the perspectiva were numerous,
and it can hardly have been unknown to Francis Bacon. In
any case it must have been known to DescarteS, to whose
epoch-making researches on Dioptrique it assuredly contributed
a stimulating influence. This at least they have in common,
that light is looked upon as correlated with other modes of
propagation of force through the Ether.

With the scientific Renascence of the sixteenth century,
Roger Bacon's name slowly emerged from the darkness which
had enwrapped it for three centuries. Astrologers like Dee,
Heyden, and Allen hailed him as a champion of their out-
worn creed. Men of greater mark and sounder judgement‚
like Selden and Mead‚ were struck by his emancipation from
the pedantry of the schools, and by his forecasts, made at so
remo'te a time, of an age of industrial and scientific discovery.
His central aim, the enlistment of progressive intellect in the
cause os moral and religious renovation, was appreciated by
none. But since the publication of his principal work in the

eighteenth century, his name has gradually ascended towards
