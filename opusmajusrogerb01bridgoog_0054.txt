SCRIPTUM PRINCJPALE. xlv

of which the persecutions and imprisonment of his later life
never allowed him to execute more than a few fragments,
And of these fragments many are lost.

This ⁶ scriptum principale,’ as he tells us in the first chapter
os the unpublishcd work entitled ‘Communia Naturalium,'
consisted, or was intended to consist, of four volumes. The
first volume dealt with Grammar and Logic‚ the second with
Mathematic, the third with Physic, the fourth with Metaphysic
and Morals.

The second chapter of the ‘ Communia Naturalium ’ is entitled,
⁸ De universo ordine scientiarum naturalium.' He distinguishes
eight natural scienceS. The first treats of the principles
common to Natural Philosophy. The others arez—(1) Per·
spective or Optic, (2) Astronomy, (3) Barology, (4) Alchemy,
(5) Agriculture‚ (6) Medicine‚ (7) Experimental Science. The
general principles of Physica form the subject os the first
treatise here spoken of. Of the seven special scienceS, the
first three form part of what would in the present day be
called Physics. Under Astronomy is included not merely the
study os planetary motions, but the scientific determination of
terrestrial ‘positions, in other wordS, Geography, and also the
influence os the stars and the sun on the earth and man:
that is to say, the study of climate and of astrological forceS.
As to the third of the special sciences‚ ‘ scientia de elementis.'
or as he also calls it, ‘scientia de Ponderibus‚' what in the
present day would be called Barology, it is not without
interest to find it thus set apart as a distinct department of
speculation. The fourth, Alkimia, correspond5‚ so sar as the
description of its purpose goes, very nearly to the modern
science of Chemistry. It deaIS, says Bacon, with the ‘mis-
tiones elementorum‚' with the generation os liquidS, gases, and
solids (‘ humores et spiritus et corpora '), with all inanimate
substanceS, including organic products (⁶ usque ad partes ani·
malium et plantarum inclusive '). .

The title os the fifth science, Agricultura, would be mis-
leading, is Bacon had not given us a clear explanation os its
purpose ¹. It is the science os living bodies, vegetal and
