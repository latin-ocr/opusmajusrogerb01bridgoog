antiquity. We are told, for instance, that certain parts of the
Scriptores ure written not in Hebrew, but fn Chaldaean. The
precise relations of these two languages ought to be made familiar
to us ............ 'ld-ii
6. Sixthly‚ the Latin text of the Scriptores, as commonly used, is
extremely corrupt, and becomes more so as tirne goes om lt needs
carefol correction by reference to the original Greek and Hebrew.
The versions in recent use by the F ranciscans and Dominicans are
far inferior to the old versions ....... ‘ll-81
7. Seventhly, when the text is correct, there is often the greatest
obscurity as to the interpretation. The same latin word corresponds
often to many totally distinct Hebrew words ..... 81-85
8. Eighthly, and lastly, since Latin grammar is formed on the
model of Greek and Hebrew grarnmar, much confusion arises from
this source. Latin words of foreign origin are not recognized3 and
conversely, to many words of Latin origin a foreign source is
erroneously given. Again mistakes occur as to the vowels aud
diphthongs in Greek that correspond to a Latio vowel The mles
for gender that hold good in Latin are not applioeble to Greek. The
same holds good of pronunciation. The penultimate of possessive
adjectives, which is long in the case of words of Latin on'gin, as
bovinum, is short where they are derived from Greek, as in such
words as crystallinum, adamantinum ...... 85-92
ln conclusion, l must point out the importance to the Church of
linguistic studies ; (ι) for explanation of the liturgy, (2) of the formulae
used in sacraments and consecrations, (3) for the due regulation of
, foreign chorches, (4) for throwing light on the future history of the
Church, (5) for intercourse with foreign nations . . . . 92-96
