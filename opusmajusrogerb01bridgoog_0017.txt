xiv PREFACE.

. a well-known astrological writer who died in 1623,
which fixes the date os this MS. at the end of the

sixteenth or beginning of the seventeenth century.
A glance at the MS. shows that the figures were
drawn simultaneously with the text, room being lest
in each page for their insertion. The character of the

writing quite correspo'nds with this date. lt is referred
to in this edition as D.

ln 1825 another MS. ‘of the Opus Majus was
bought lor the Bodleian Library. lt belonged at one
time to Thomas Allen, the astrologer of Gloucester
Hall, who early in the seventeenth century gave twenty
MSS. to the Bodleian. This one, however, passed
into the possession os Sir Kenclm Digby, whose well-
known signature and motto are inscribed on the first
page. It is now numbered 235 of the Digby MSS.
The greater part os it is ol the fifteenth century.
But a portion os it (pp. 249-295) is in an older and
more beautiful handwriting, considered by Mr. Coxe
to be os the sourteenth century. This portion in·
eludes a considerable portion of the Perspectz'va.

These two MSS. have been carelully collated lor
the present edition. ln the course of the collation
unmistakable proof was given that the Dublin MS.

was a copy of that in the Bodleian. At the close of -

p. 470, col. 2, of this latter, the sentence breaks oft
midway, and is continued on the first line of p. 487,
col. 1. An error of this kind, analogous to that caused
by the transposition of sheets in binding a modern
book, is easily explicable. ln the Dublin MS. the
same rupture of the sentence occurs, but in the middle
of a column (sol. 224, col. a, line 12), the sentence
being ultimately continued on sol. 229, col. d, line 14.
l t may bc added that these two MSS. exhibit through·
