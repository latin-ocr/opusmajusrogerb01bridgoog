portrayed, but as radiations centred in the primal lorm, the
mind oi God.

Tuming to Bacon, who discusses the question os universale
at considerable length and with extreme independence, we
lind the same tendency to emancipate himself from bondage
to words, entities, and verbal discussions, and to dig down to
a foundation ol solid lact. One individual, he says ¹, is oi more
account than all the universals in the world. A universal is
nothing but the similarity ol several individuale ; ‘convenientia
plurium individuorum.’ ‘Two things‚' he goes on to say,
‘are needlul sor the individual. The first is absolute: it
is that which constitutes his existence, as when we say,
“This man is made ol soul and body.” The second is
that in which he resembles another man, and not an ass or
a pig. This is his universal. But the absolute nature oi an
individua] isos lar more importance than his related nature.
it is fixed and absolute by itsell. Thus the singular is ol
more account (nobilius) than its universal. Experience leads
us to this conclusion, and so also does theology. God has
not created the world ior the sake os the universal man, but
ior the sake of individual persons' ‘individuum est natura
absoluta et fixa habens esse per se; et universale non est nisi
convenientia individui respectu alterius'

In some passages Bacon appears to go much further in
the direction os nominalism than Albert and Aquinas. ‘The
prevalent view,’ he remarks, ‘is that universals exist only in
the mind. Yet two stones would be like one another, even .
though there should be no mind to perceive them. But it is
precisely this likeness oi the two stones that constitutes their
universal’ (‘ Commun. Natur.’ Part II. Dist. ii. ch. ιο).

Closely allied with the controversy asto universals was the
question oi individuation. Are things individualized by form
or by matter? Albert and Aquinas took the latter view,
llonaventura the former. ‘Individuorum multitudo,’ says
Albert (De Coelo, tract. iii. c. 8), ‘lit omnis per divisionem
materiae. Formae quae sunt receptibiles in materia indivi-
