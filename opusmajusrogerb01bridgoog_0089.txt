of the Trinity. ‘Impossibile est,’ he says (Quaest. xxxii.
art. r), ‘per rationem naturalem ad cognitionem Trinitatis
divinarum personarum pervenire! But be goes on to explain
that there are two modes of employing reason. One is to
discover and prove a principle: as in physica we prove the
uniformity of the motion of the heavens. The second mode
is, when the principle is admitted, to show that certain observed
effects are consistent with and follow from it. So, for instance,
assuming the reality of our hypotheses as to eccentrics and
epicycles, we can show that the movements of the planeta
take place in accordance with these hypotheses. It is this
latter form of reasoning that we use in reference to the

Trinity. '‘Trinitate posita, congruunt hujusmodi rationes? '

We find analogies with this doctrine when we consider what
passes in our own minds. ‘lpse conceptus cordis de ratione
sua habet quod ab alio procedat, scilicet a notitia concipientis'
(Quaest. xxxiv. art. ι). ‘Quanto aliquid magis intelligitur,
tanto conceptio intellectualis est magis intima intelligenti et
magis unum . . . unde curn divinum intelligere sit in fine per-
fectionis . . . necesse est quod Verbum divinum sit perfecte
unum curn eo a quo procedit, absque omni diversitate' (Quaest.
xxvii. art. 1). Similarly (art. 3), the procession of the Third
Person is likened to the operation of the will which we call in
human beings love. ‘Processio Verbi attenditur secundum
actionem intelligibilem. Secundum autem operationem volun·
tatis invenitur in nobis quaedam alia processio, scilicet processio ’
amoris, secundum qnam amatum est in amante, sicut per
conceptionem verbi res dicta vel intellecta est in intelligente.
Unde et, praeter processionem Verbi, ponitur alia processio in
divinis, quaeest processio amoris ¹.'

Bacon, as we might expect, was not less eager to find the
mysteries of revelation loreshadowed by human reason.
Holding, as he has fully explained in the second part of the

¹ lt is perhaps hardly necessary to refer in this connexion to Hampden's
lectores on Tru Scholasn'c Philosophy consrilered in its relatrbn to Clmlstr'an
Theology. Compare p. fir (second edition), ‘The object of the Scholastic
Theology was to detect and draw forth from the Scriptura, by aid of the subtle
analysis of the philosophy of Aristone, the mystical truths of God on which
the Scripture Revelation was conceived to be founded!
