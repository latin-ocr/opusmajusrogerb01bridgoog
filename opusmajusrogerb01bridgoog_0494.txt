oportet relinqui quod incertum est, et lieri sermonem de eo andat-
quod philosophis magnis innotescit. Ptolemaeus² inter ¹¹⁵
omnes ab incarnatione Domini maxime certificavit in hac
parte, etin secundo Almagesti quartam istam, in qua sumus,
distinguit. Et ejus et Aliragani et aliorum divisio magis nota
est per septem climata famosa. Clima vero apud eos est
spatium terrae in quo dies prolixior excedit per dimidiam
horam diem prolixiorem alterius partis terrae, vel exceditur
ab eodem. Certum tamen est quod magis naturalis et verior
distinctio esset penes quartam horae, secundum quod
Ptolemaeus primo dividit: sed quia istae partes sunt parvae,
ideo considerant philosophi majores et conjunxerunt duas
illarum in uno climate Et quoniam haec climata et civitates
famosae in eis non possunt evidenter percipi sermone, oportet

¹The words, ‘et medietatem coluri . . . medietatis aequinoctialis’ are
printed twice over in Jebb's edition.

¹ ln the first printed editiones Ptolemy's Cosinogmpluia, dedicated to Pope
Sixtus IV, in 1478, there are twenty-seven maps: one ol the world, ten ol
Europe, loures Africa, twelve ol Asia. These correspond exactly to -the
description given in the eighth book ol the cwnogmpna ln all ol them
parallels ot* latitude and meridiana are given, as in modern Atlasea In his map
ol the World, embracing as it did, on his system, 180 degrees ol longitude and
80 degrees nl latitude, a very elaborate and scientific attempt is made to project
those curved lines accurately on a plane surlaee. lt appears probable that
these rnaps are the work ol Agathodaemon ol Alexandria a contemporary ol
Ptolemy. [Bunbury, vol. ii. p. 578]

'l’he parallels ol latitude are twenty-five in number: lour ol' South latitude,
twenty-one ol North. 'lhey are arranged according to the length ol the day at
the Summer solstice, by intervals ol one quarter ol an honr. Beginning with
16⁰ 25' S. where the longest day is thirteen houm, proceeding north to the
Equator where it is twelve; thence northwards to lat 45⁰. From this point
the parallels are drawn at hall-hourly intervals to lat 58⁰, where the longest day
is eighteen hours. Tite next parallel is drawn at 61⁰, the day being nineteen
hours; the last at ⁶3⁰, where it is twenty hours. This, says Ptolemy, is the
latitude ol' lhule. ·

ln Ptolemy's Atlas longitude is calculated in degrees and hall degrees, taking
as the startingpoint the meridien ol the fortunate islands (Ferro in the 'Canary
islands), which he wnongly estimared as being only 2⁰ 30' west ol the Sacred
Promontory (Cape St. Vincent). F urther, owing to his acceptante ol Posidonius'
estimate ol the Earth's magnitude, 180,ooo stadia, his degrees ol longitude as
measured on the Equator, were only 50⁰ stadia (ie. lilty geographical miles
instead ol sixty).
