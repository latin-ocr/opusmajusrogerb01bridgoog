the agent up to a given degree ol loroe. ln inanimate agents the force

is simply proportionate to the quantity, however small the quantity

may be. It may be so small as not to be appreciable by the seuses,

and yet none the less act. For instance, the smallest particle ol

matter, all appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, possesses

gravity ........... 438-441.
(b) The whole agent acts along the whole line of its depth on the

patient; not merely that extremity ol the agent which comes into con-

tact with the patient . - ........ 441-442
(c) Α certain definite portion ot' the patient is affected by the agent,

and no more. The sun and the moon diffuse light through similar

dimensions of the medium, although with enormous differences ol

. intensity, corresponding to their differences ol magnitude. . 442-443
(d) Will less than that definite portion suffice sor the action? lt

will not, unless that lesser portion be disunited from the rest, so as

to become a whole in itsell ........ 443
te) Does half ol the agent acton hals ot the portion affected, or does

tlte whole act on the whole portion? The whole acts on the whole

portion ........... 443444
(f) Does the hals os this portion first affected, carry ou the change

’ to the second halt, or does the whole change come from the agent?

The latter is the true view ........ stt-445

CHAPTER V.

(alwith regard to the patient, how can terrene substance he
acted on by celestial, which is ol different kind, since celestial is
incorruptible? The reply is that whatever the difference between
celestial and terrestrial substance, yet the species generated by the
former are communicable to the latter ..... tto-tto

(b) One celestial body may act on another3 not by changing its
specific nature, but hy bringing that nature to greater per·
lection ............ 446447

(c) We must admit that, in a certain sense, terrene things act on
celestial, since there isa sense in which all parts of the universe are
assimilable to all the rest. ln vision species pass lrom the eye to the
object seen. Such species do not change the specific nature ol the
celestial object, nor intersere with its superiority; they do but draw
out that which it has in common with the lower . . . 447-449

CHAPTER Vl.

We have, lastly, to consider what corporat agents are capable ot
completlng their action on patients affected by thern. (The earth, as
the central point os the universe is ,the great region ot change. The
