xcviii ANALYSIS OF THE ‘OPUS MAJUS?

vot. 1. PAGES

The Erythraean Sibyl lived between the taking of Troy and the
founding of Rome, in the seventh Olympiad‚ 433 years afterward

Hesiod, Homer’s successor, is prior to the foundation of Rome„
Romulus, Thales of Miletus, and Hezekiah were contemporaries . 49-51

CHAPTER xl.

With Thales began tbe series of the wise men of Greece3 he
himself was in Josiah's time; Pittacus, Solon, Bias and others, were
contemporary with the Jewish captivity. Shortly afterwards arose
the italic school of Greek philosophy, Pythagoras at their head, in
the time of the Jewish restoration; Tarquinius Superbus reigning
at Rome ........... 51-52

CHAPTER ΧΠ.

Pythagoras was followed by Archytas, Timaeus, and others; but

knowledge will continually be made. Little use was made of his
teaching till after the time of Mahomet‚ when Avicenna, Averroes

some of his logical works. A great stimulus was given to the study
of Aristotle by Michael Scot's translations, with commentaries, of his
physical and metaphysical works. Of Avicenna's commentaries,
however, not more thanathird part has yet been translated . 54-56

CHAPTER XIV.
