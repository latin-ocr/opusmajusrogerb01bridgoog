lt may be further observed that the time occupied bya lumiuous
radiation may be so small as to be imperceptible to our senses even
when the distance traversed is very great. Aristocle's supposed
denial oi it was a denial oi the view ol Empedocles that a corporeal
body was transmitted across space. But the luminous radiation is
not a body, but a iorrn continually renewing itseli out ol the particles
of the medium, as it travels. lt is true, as Aristode says, that there ·
is a difference between the transmission oi light and that oi sound
and other sensory impressione. With sound there are three distinct
displacements ot material penicles, viz. motion ol the body struck,
tremor oi the air, and rarefaction ol the air. Nothing ot this kind
. takes plaoe with light, lor though light makes heat and rarelies the
air, yet it is transmitted through celestial spaces where rarefactioo
and beat-production is impossible. ln the uansrnission ol odonis,
again, there are special differences. But all need time: though not
the same time We see the stroke oi a dietam hammer before we
hear it. Lightning reaches us before thuoder.

CHAPTER 1.

We uray now inquire with greater precision ot' what matters vision
talres cognizance, what degree ol certainty it brings, and to what
errors (limiting ourselves to direct vision) it is exposed. Knowledge
is either given to us direetly and immediately by sense, or indirectly
and peraccidens. Supposing the eight conditious described to be
present in just degree, the eye will perceive the twenty-two qualities
previously noted, with or without the help oi the other special senses,
and oi Sensus Communis aud Imaginatio (pp. 4-5). By qualities
indirectly sensiblel mean those which oome under our cognitance
through sensatico, but which are appreciated by other iaculties, as
judgement3 aswhen a lamb seeing an object ot the torm and colour
ol a voli, knows it to be an enemy. When l see a man, 1 see an
animated object and a substance3 thus io an indirect 'way substance
may be spoken ol as sensihle. Agnis, the sensatione peculiar to one
