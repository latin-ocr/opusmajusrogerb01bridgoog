mirror, hindering the perception oi the highest truth Sin bliltldsllimiams

soul; and hence the view ol Socrates that evil actions result from
ignorante. There is a natural shame at sin forits vileness; a con-
sciousness that it lowers to the level os the beasts, each race of whom
typifies some one among human vices. We take our tone from those
around us sor good or evil: hence it is ol the utmost moment with
whom we associate. This truth also is illustrated by the lower
animals, as Boetius has pointed out. Much importance is attached
by Seneca and others to sels-examination at the close ol each day, as
to the control or the encouragement that has boen given to vicious
impulse. Such control, as Aristotle and Seneca insist, should be
exercised lrom childhood ........ tta-266

CHAPTER IV.

From virtue and vice in general we pass to special virtues and
vices. We find that the teaching ol ancient philosophers relates to
Avarice, Pride, Lust, Gluttony, Anger, Envy, and Sloth-in other
words, to the seven mortal sins. Ol these, all hutone, Anger, relate
to pleasure and prosperity; Anger only has to do with adverse
circumstances. Let us begin with the former class. Disregard ol
wealth was preached and practised by Aristotle and a long series ol
philosophers. Seneca and Ptolemy have pointed out that this earth
is but an infinitesimal part ol the universe, and that the disputes of
contending nations forits possession are like the quarrels oi ants lor
an anthill. Apuleius, in his study of Socrates, has insisted strongly
on the distinction between the inner man and the casual accidente ol
health‚ strength, or wealth that surround him. Sallust and Seneca

have spoken of the general corruption that has followed the pursuit
ol wealth ........... attalo

CHAPTER V.

As to sexual desire, Archytas and Cicero have said much ol its
disturhing influence on reason. Aristotle in his exhortations to
Alexander dwelt on this, audon the degradation ol man through
lust to the level ol the brutes. Seneca and Cioero have dwelt on
the same subject. On Gluttony and Drunkenness Seneca has
enlarged in his discourse to Helvia, and in his other letters. He
speaks ol it as throwing the door open to lust, cruelty, and other
vices. Cicero quotes a letter of the philosopher Anachmsis upholding
the advantage ot simplicity of lite. Plato, Avicenna, and others have

said much ol the necessity os setting the mind lree from the trammels
ol the body ........... attath
