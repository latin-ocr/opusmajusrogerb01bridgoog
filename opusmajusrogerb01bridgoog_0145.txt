cxxxvi ANALYSIS OF THE ‘OPUS MAJUs!

ol our senses are indirectly appreciated by another, as when we see ·
iron to be bot, or ground to be wet. For cold, heat, moistnre and
dryness cannot be directly appreciated by tbe eye . . . 'id-'ib i

CHAPTER ΙΙ.

The question arises, Do all sensible things oi which the eye takes ·
cognitance propagate rays to tbe eye, or light and colour only? The .
latter is the true view. These other things are magnitudes or
properties ol magnitudes, and belong to matter, which is passive, not
active The air which is the medium oi sound is itsels soundless, and
the medium of colom, colourless. They are called sensible, not
because they emit species to the sense, but because the sense
appreciates them. All that is really necessary lor vision are the rays
ol light and colunt, combined with the ray directed to the object lrom
the eye ............ 'lb-79

CHAPTER 111.

Knowledge comes to usin three ways: (ι) by sensatior pure and
simple, as when a colonr strikes the eye without remembrance oi any
previous colour; (2) by similitude ol the present sensation with
a past sensation remembered; (3) by a ratiocinative process, as
when we judge an object to be transparent because we are able to
see an opaque body behind it But, although the process by which
our perception takes place is one ol reasoning‚ it takes place so
instantaneously that we are not aware that we reason. We are
logicians instinctively, without having names lor the various steps
which the mind takes. These three modes os knowledge bave been
inappropriately named, Sensation, Science, and Syllogism . . tlt-82

CHAPTER 1.

These whose eyes are deep-set see further than those whose eyes
are prominent. First‚ because the eye is nearer to the brain.
Secondly, because it is better preserved t'rom external injuty.
Thirdly‚ because the visual force being compressed within a
narrower channel issues with greater energy and directness We
osten prolong this channel by holding tbe bollow ol the band ⁸
