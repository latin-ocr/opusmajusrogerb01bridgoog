lt has often been remarked that Roger Bacon was supported by Albertus
Magnus, by Aquinas, and indeed, all the best thinkers of his time in bis convic-
tion of the truth of astrology. To a believer in a limited and spherioal universe
with a terrestrial centre, nothing could seem more valid as aworking hypothesis
for explaining physical changes on the eartb's surfaee than tbat alterations of ¹
the directions in which the planets were seen should be followed by corre
sponding alterations of terrestrial objecta The combinations ofplanetary bodies
as seen in conjunctiora, in opposition, or in intermediate positions,0ll'ered awide
field of speculation, which became practioally boundless when to the appa·
rent relation of these bodies to one another were added their apparent relations
(also ever varying) with the lixed stars. Human and terrestrial events com·
plicated as they might be, were paralleled by equal complication in the play of
celestial forces. lt may be said on the whole that so far from belief in astrulogy
being a reproach to Bacon and his contemporaries, to have disbelieved in it
would have been in the thirteenth century a sign of intellectual weakneas. lt
conformed to the first law of Comte'a ptdoeoptm prim as being the beat hypo-
thesis of which the ascertained phenomena admitted.

When the universe was unloclred by the Copemican theory, it might have
been supposed that astrology would speedily disappear. Yet it was not so.
Francis Bacon‚ writing three centuries and a half aster Roget Bacon, had not
abandoned belief in it, and Campanella's work (Astrologicomm iibri sex) pub-
lished in 1629, isa treatise that Roger Baton might himself bave written.
‘Sunt causae ipsae stellae‚' says campanella (lib. ii. ι), nedum signa, ut optime
probat S.Thomas; corporearum mutationum per se, voluntariarum per accidens.

. .. Omne judicium astrologicam aut est de mutationibus aeris et maris et telluris;
unde de penuria et abundantia rerum nobis utilium et noxiarum ratiocinamur3
aut de monarchia et remur publicarum initiis et mutationibus, et de gentium et
legum et morum translationibus et civitatum et provinciarum: aut de cujusque
hominis ortu vita morte et eventibus, aut tandem de bonis malisque electionibus

rerum agendarum.

¹ ln Opus Tertium, chap. 68, p. 274, there is an almost exact repetition of
what follows in the next sixteen pages. [ln 0. these are altogether omitted.
'l'he Cottonian MS. (Jul.) supplies them] lt ls probable that the scribe
copied the MS. of Opus Tertium since in the passages of that work here
referred to, Bacon explains that what had been said in the copy of Opus Hujus
sent to the Pope on the subiect of the calendar, was not in all respects conset,
anthat, be goes ou to say, ‘bic iterum feci transcribi et correxi)
