clii ANALYSIS oF THE ‘OPUS MAJUS.’

VOL- 11. PAGES

These colours appear to have some relation to the various structures
of the eye. In addition to the problem of the rainbow, there is the
problem of haloes and coronae. On this 1 give the best explanation
that as yet occurs to me. 1 do not however pretend that it is satis-
factory. Far more careful experiments, made with properly con·
structed instruments‚ are needed before an adequate explanation

can be given “ . . . . . . . . . . 196-201

In all sciences Experiment is able to reveal truths quite un-
connected with the discussion of principleS‚ and with regard to
which it is useless in the first instance to assign a reason. The
initial state of mind should be readiness to believe; this should be
followed by experiment: reasoning should come last. 1 subjoin
examples of my meaning.

1. The astronomer constructs his spherica! astrolabe, by which he
can observe the precise longitude and latitude of heavenly bodies
at different times, But it is not inconceivable that experiment may
devise means of bringing this instrument into such relation with
the revolution of the heavens that it should follow their course. The
motion of the tide5‚ the periodic changes in certain diseaseS, the
diurnal opening and closing of flowerS, are facts tending to belief
that such a discovery is possible. 1f effected it would Supersede all
other astronomical instruments . . . . . . . 202-203

2. My next example relates to the act of prolonging human life.
As yet we have nothing to rely on but ordinary rules of health.
These are observed but by few, and usually not till the close of life,
when it is too late. 1f a suitable regimen were observed by all,
no doubt life would be much prolonged. But there are special
remedies unknown as yet to medicine, but to be found by experiment,
which may extend the period of life much further. Observation of
the habits of certain animals may guide us to truths on this matter
which are as yet hidden. Other indications are given in the works
of Aristotle, Pliny, ArtephiuS, and others. A combination of gold,
pearl, flower of sea-dew, spermaceti, aloeS, bone of stag’s heart, flesh
of Tyrian snake and of Aethiopian dragon, properly prepared in due
proportionS, might promote longevity to an extent hitherto un·
imagined . . . . . . . . . . . 204-208

3. A third example may be found in Alchemy. The problem here
is not merely to transmute the baser into the more precious metals,
but to promote gold to its highest degree of perfectiori. In this
persected gold we should probably have a further aid to the prolonga·

tion of life . . . . . . . . . . . 214—215
