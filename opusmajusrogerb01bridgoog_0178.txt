infinite. ln one world at least there can be only one. And if there
should be more worlds than one, the same infinite God is capable of
governing them. But plurality of worlds is an hypothesis which
Aristotle has dissipated; for they would all tend to the same centra}
point, and lose their separate existence ..... tlt-3⁸1
God being one 3ηά infinite, man is bound to. yield Him boundless
reverence, in thankfulness for his creation and for his hopes of future
happiness. Even the Pagans believe in a future life3 so do the
Saracens, although their belief is tainted with thoughts of animal
enjoyments. The Jews have the same belief. Thus the Buddhists
have universal opinion against them. This present life is full of
misery, from which we must believe that the future life will be free.
ln our glorified body and soul we shall participate io the divine
nature. So too will the punishmentof the evil be infinite. This then
is the twofold motive for doing the will of God. But man cannot of
himself know that will; as the difference of his religions show,
differences which exist even within the pale of Christianity. Of the
true nature even of material things we are profoundly ignorant ;
much more of things immaterial ...... ael-383
Therefore Revelation is necessary. Aristode bas said that in
these things the human mind is as the eye of the owl or bat to the
light ol the sun, or, as Avicenna says, as the deaf man to musical
harmnny, or as the untaught child to the highest truth. Man, says
Seneca, is too mortal for immortal things. And apart from intrinsic
inability to discem infinite truth he is blinded by sin. Man must
thereforebetaught by divine authority ..... 383-385
All sects claim such authority. We have to consider to which of

them has true revelation been made Evidently to one only, since
God is one; there is only one world and one human racc. Avicenna
and Alpharabius fully recognize this. We have therefore to choose
between the six religions of which 1 have spoken. The Pagans and

the idolaters‚ who take creatures for God‚ or who essert plurality of

gods, may be at once eliminated. When confronted by the Tartar

emperor with Christians and Mahometans, they at once succumbed.

The Tartars‚ while accepting the unity of God‚ worship fite, and their

teachers are mere magicians. lt is clear therefore that they are not

in possession of the authoritative truth which we seelt. This they

themselves have consessed. We must therefore examine the remain-

ing three religions-Jewish, Mahommedan, and Christian . 386-388
The superiority of the Christian law is proved first by the authority

of philosophy, which asi have before shown has given its sanction ⁸

to the principal doctrines of Christianity. No such testimony has

been given to Judaism or Mahommedanism. Seneca has attacked

the Jewish creed; and Mahommedanism has been asserted by
