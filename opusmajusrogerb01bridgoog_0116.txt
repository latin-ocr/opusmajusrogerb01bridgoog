God. Nor is it enough to say that matter is infinite potentially‚ but
not in easence. Nor that it is potentially infinite in the sense in
which this is said ol continuous quantity. for to attribute to matter
existence in indefinite numbers oi substauoes isto attribute to it
infinity, not merely potentially, but in aet. The contradiction in which
this lands us may be set forth geometrically. Nothing infinite ean
have finite power, and conversely nothing finite can have infinite

power ............ lta-148

CHAPTER lx.

When two spheres are brought together, and the straight lines from
their centres to the point ol contact are continuom, the question
arises whether these lines become one, or whether we are to
regard them as two. Averroes maintained a distinction between
mathematical quantity and natural quantity. But this distinction

is untenable. The lines in question are two, although they have
the effect of one, and sor convenience of speech may be spoken oi
as one. Against the separability ol different masses ol matter it
is argued that if two circular planes are brought into contact
and then separated, air will penetrate into the outer portion before
the inner, henoe ior a moment there will be a vacuum in the central
part. But the answer is that the separation is not simultaneous
throughout the whole sursace oi the plane, so that the air penetratas
gradually. From the divisibility of matter, it is not to be argued that
the world is composed of an infinite number ol material particles, as
Leucippus and Democritus maintained Were this so, it might be
inferred that the diameter os the square was commensurable with its

side3 which Euclid in the seventh pmposition os his tenth book has

shown to be impossible ........ lte-152

CHAPTER X.

On geometrical grounds the shape ol the universe can be inserted
ro be spherical. No other form would preclude the possibility ol

a vacuum in the course ol its revolution. Cylindrical or lenticular ·

form would suffice if revolution took plaoe round a certain axis. With
the spherical form revolution round whatsoever axis would avoid
vacuum. Looked at from within, it must be mneave and spherica13

os the universe would nothe equah Further, the sphere is that lorm
which under a given suriece has the greatest content. lt is the
simplest and noblest of forms. The water, the air, and the fire
