BA CON'S LIFE. x'xxiii

on his condemnation in 1277 was effective and rigorous.
Appeals to the Pope had been anticipated by jerome, who
took care to impress on the court of Rome the expediency
os confirming his decision. All hopes of completing the
Scriptum Principale were shattered. He remained a prisoner,
so it is thought, for fourteen years. Jerome meantime had
become Pope Nicholas IV. After his death in 1292,
a chapter of the Franciscans was held in Paris, at which
Raymond Gaufredi‚ then General of the Order‚ set free some
of those who had been condemned in 1277. It may be
looked upon as nearly certain that Bacon was of the
number. Certain at least it is from his own words that in
that year he was again at work, on his last treatise, the Com-
pendium Theolaeiae, in which the date 1292 is expressly
mentioned. Whether he died in this year, or two years
afterwards is uncertain. He was buried in the Franciscan
church in Oxford.

The legend that his works were nailed to the walls of the
library and allowed to perish ignominiously may be dismissed.
But that his life-long efforts to establish a Catholic school of
progressive learning utterly sailed, there can be no doubt
whatever. Such men as Rich, Grosseteste‚ and Bacon, were
not seen at Oxsord in the fourteenth century. Greek, mathe—
matics, and experimental science were overwhelmed in the
paralyzing mists of Scotian dialectic. Nevertheless it would
be an error to suppose that his life-work was a sailure.
Here and there throughout Europe the tradition of the Doctor
Mirabilis survived as a stimulating force, and kept the embers
of scientific study alive till the time of the Renascence.

In proof of this, three instances may be given :—

1. Peter d'Ailly, in his Imago Mundi, written early in the
fifteenth century, discussing the relations os the extreme east
and west of the habitable globe, has a long passage treating
os the probable proximity os Spain and India. For all that
appears in the’ work this passage is his own. But in fact it is
a verbal quotation from the fourth part os the Opus Mcy‘uS,
vol. i. p. 290. And it has a history worth recording. For it is
cited in 1498 in a letter from Columbus to Ferdinand and
