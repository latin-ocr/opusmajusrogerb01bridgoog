cxxxiv ANALYSIS OF THE ‘OPUS MAJUS?

power ol the' eye to send out radiations, which we have seen to
be an essential lactor in vision,'is limited. And as such limitation
οἱ penetrating power implies visibility, we have in extreme distance
a reason why extremely rare bodies become visible. The blue colour
oi the sky is to be explained as in the case ot' deep water. Blue is
the colour which most nearly approaches blackness; it results here
from the shadows thrown by each particle ol airon succeeding
particles. li the heavenly spheres were opaque, it might besupposed
that they would be visible objects. But theological reasoning shows
that they are not opaque. Beyond the eight stellar spheres is the
sphere ol water, and beyond that again the tenth lt may be asked
how is it that we see a ray ol light passing through a window, though
in this case the air being· warmed by the sun is rarer than the air
surrounding it? The reply is that what we see is not the luminous
ray but the boundaries ol the denser air which it penetrates As to
the heavenly spheres, it has been already shown that they are
themselves transparent, the star placed in each ol them being
opaque ............ 62-66

CHAPTER 11.

The sixth condition ol vision is Rarity ol the Medium. lt is
objected that flame is rarcr than air, and yet that a flame placed
between the object and the eye impedes vision. But it is a
mistake to suppose that llame is rarer; and Alhazen, who has been
quoted as saying this, is misinterpreted. Whether a lynx sees
through a wall or not, the human eye which we are here considering
certainly does not. On the other hand, we are not to suppose
a vacuum between heaven and earth. Radiation oi species would

be impossible in that case. A vacuum is a mere mathematical
abstraction ........... teet

CHAPTER llI.

The seventh condition is Time. Time, as Aristotle shows, is needed

ior au actos memory: much more sor an act ot' sensation. lt has

¹ been maintained that radiations t'rom the object and the eye talre
place in an indivisible instant ol time. F or il not, then the particles

ol time, however small, would {orm a perceptible aggregate while the
radiation passes lrom the east oi the beaveris to the west. This

view is held by all but Alhazen, and by him is contested on in·
sufficient grounds. Some however ol his arguments against it are

· sound‚ resting as they do on Aristotlels doctrine that finite energy
requires time forits operation, the time being inversely as the
energy. Suppose the energy infinite, then, and then only, does

the time become zero· The notion that the ray is spiritual not
