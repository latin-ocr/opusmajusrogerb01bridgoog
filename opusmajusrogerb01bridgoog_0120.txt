Filth head. This relates to geometrical lorms3 and again it
basto be premised that the spiritual meaning ol Scriptum is not
to be grasped, unless the literal meaning be first understood. The
precise iorrn ol the ark, the tabernacle, the temple should be pre·
sented to us with mathematicalaccuracy3 it will then be possible to
interpret their mystical signification. A remarkable ‘case in point
is the rainbow, ol which we are told that it is a symbolos God’s
promise as to the Deluge. The meaning ol this is misundemtood
lor want or' understanding the geometry ol the rainbow‚ which is
produced by the solar mys striking on the raindrops and being
refracted or reflected thence. Only by geometry can such a text
as that ol the tlireelold buming ol mountains by the sun be under-
stood. The mountains receive direct rays. The rays reflected by
thern are locussed in the air and contribute to warin them. iastly,
there are the doubly refracted rays passing lrom the sun into the
clouds and frorn the clouds into the air. Again, the rays may lall
either vertically‚ or obliquely, or horizontally, producing different
effects in each case. The laws as to the passage ol light through
space apply equally to the passage ol all other forces. Ol all these
things there is a spiritual interpretation. Direct vertiml rays may
be compared to the action ol grace on the righteous; they neither
reflect nor refract it. ln the wicked we soe the light driven away,
reflected: in the imperfect it is bent aside, refracted. lt is to be
noted here that the geometrical lorrn of the triangle is specially
adapted to symbolize the Trinity. Each angle is distinct yet each
embraces the whole space. Again‚ our geometrical principles asto
the action ol forces rnay be applied to the estimation of the forces ol
templatim, which act in proportion to their proximity. Hence the
need ol keeping the tempted as iar removed as possible from the

objects which tempt ......... 210-219

Sixth head. This relates to number. (a) As with geometrioel
forms, so with number there is a spiritual meaning behind the literal
meaning. (b) For the understanding ol chronicles it is necessary to
know the different systems of numeration‚ and to be able to convert
one into another. (cl There are various arithmetica! operations in
the Jewish law requiring a knowledge ot the subject. (d) There are
manycomrptions in the text which only an arithmetician can unravel.
(e) The perfectione inherent in the number three can only he under·
stood by arithmeticians (j) Arithmetic is neoessary in astronomy‚
which we have seen to be needful to the theologiam Some instances
ol its value in astronomy are here given. We have to define the
length of a line on the earth's surlace oorresponding to a degree.
We must take a mile as 4,ooo cubits: a cubit as 1} feet. llow many
miles must we walls northward from agiven point to lind the pole-
