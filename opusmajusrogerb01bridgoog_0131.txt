T his geographical description should be followed by an account
which -Ι bevenot been able to complete, (a) ol the stars, (b) of the ,
planets, (c) ol the way in which the climatic disposition ol each place
is affected by them, (d) thus making true astrological judgements
possible, (e) with ¹the result ol promoting the salety ol the state. All
that l can do is to offer a lew remarks on these points. Each of the
lixed stars bas proporties ol its own. Those os the twelve signs are
specially important to us. .Α special treatise would be needed to
describe these characteristica adequately and to point out the way
in whioh weare affected by them. Each planet has also its special
character, moditied by the zodiacal sign in which they are situate, by
their aspects, that is by any two or more ol them being in the same,
in opposite, or in intermediate directions, by the position reached in
their ¹epicycle or secennio, and hythe ·House ol the heavens which
they maybe occupying. This again requiresaspecial treatise.. sisara

From this we pass to the effectsproduced bytheheavens on places
and things-upon the earth. The sun may be said to beget no less
than the parent: and the sun’sinlluence endures through life. Each
spot on the earth's surlace is the centre of a distinct horizon, and is
thus affected differently from every other. We have to consider its
distance from the pole and tlre equator, what stars arein the zenith,
and what signs are dominant there. -On all these points the Hebrew
astronomers are speciallyinstructive. Special parts ol the body are
affected bydill'erent constellatione, and hythe position ol the moon
in them. Each hour ol the day is under the control ol a particular
planet. On medical art especially, hut also on all-other departments
of human activity, the bearing of all this is obvious. The quarters
ol the moon must be ol course studied‚ and also the daily transit ol

Besides the revolutions oi the moon and sun, attention must be
given to those ol the planete, especially to those ol longer period.
