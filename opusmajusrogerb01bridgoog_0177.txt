Christian law. The Tartars, though governed by Mars, in like
manner are modified by Mercury, which irnplies Christian influence.
The Pagans, again, and the ldolaters may differ according as the
influence of Mars or of the Sun may prevail. With the Pagans,
terrestial things as wellas celestial may be objects of worship . 370-372
We have now to consider the means of showing the trutb of the
Christian religion. We may appeal to miracles; or we may take
the ground of reason and philosophy common to us and the other
sects. Though the Christian should not place his chief reliance on
reason, yet he should be able to render an account of the faith that
is in him. And as the heathen do not accept this faith, we must
challenge them on philosophical ground. Philosophyis given to men
for the very purpose ol leading them to truth . . . . 372-373
ln what follows l am appealing to the wise among thern rather
than the simple There are three kinds of knowledge: that coming
from our own study or experience; that which is learnt from
others, and that which is natural, in the sense of being shared by
the whole species. lt is no less natural to act on such truth than to
know it. Praetical and speculative reason bave the same source, and
are essentially the same, asflAristotle has taught . . . 373-375
The existence of God is one of these natural huths, as Cicero bas
said. The necessity of demonstrating it comes from the weakening
effect of sin on our faculties. The divine unity is not known by
nature3 and even those who accept itare in error as to God's
attributes. These therefore have to be explained, beginning, as the
mathematician begins, with elementary principles. That God is an
eternal first Causc of infinite wisdom, power, and goodness is accepted
by the Tartars, Saracens, Jews, and Christians. Pagans cannot deny
this truth when presented to them; as the recent conference in
Tartary between Christiana, Saracens, and Buddhists has shown.
Their resistance elsewhere to Christianity is due to attempts to

impose on thern a foreign yoke ...... 375-377
The Christian advocate may further plead that in tracing causes

we cannot go back endlessly. There must, as Aristotle has laid -

down, be a first Cause, that has always existed, and must exist for
0 ever, unchangeably. Boethius has shown that imperfectiori implies
perfectiori, to which it is an approximation. Perlect power, as
Aristotle shows, is boundless power: and if the power of God be
infinite, a sortion' is His essence infinite. lt follows that His good-
ness is infinite3 and from infinite power and goodness follows the
attribute ol infinite wisdom, Such a cause is capable therefore of
creating this world, and is disposed to govem it in the best way.
lf it be said that the world is eternal, this is to raise it to equality
with God. 1t more than one Cause is asserted, then none can be
