xxxviii INTRODUCYION.

01 either, except through the criticism of their opponents‚
notably through that 01 Albert and Aquinas, yet such criti·
cism is too detailed and definite to admit of doubt that their
deductions from Aristotle and from his Arabiau commen·
tators led them to the assertiou of the unity of substanee;
in other words, to the ultimate identity of matter, mind, and
God. As quoted by Albert, the language of David was:
‘lt is manifest that there is one sole substance, not only'
of all bodies, but also of all souis, and that this is nothing
but God himself. God, matter, and mind, are one and the
same sole substance' (Albert. Summa Theolog. part 11.
tract. xii. quaest. 72, memb. 4, art. 2). David kept himself
within the lirnits 01 philosophie theory. He is said to have
been personally intimate with innocent 111; and at least
during his lifetime his heresies escaped notice. It was
otherwise with his contemporary Amaury of Bennes, who,
maintaining the same opinions, was condemned by the Pope
and forced publicly to disavow them. But they survived in
his disciples who used them in ways directly hostile to
Catholic faith and discipline. A Council was held in Paris
in 1210. Amaury's body was disinterred and buried in un-
consecrated ground; several of his followers were bumt. It
was at this council, the decrees of which were confirmed and
enforced five years afterwards by Robert de Coureon, the
papal legate, that the study 01 the Physic and Metaphysic of
Aristotle was prohibited, on the mistaken suppositiou that
the ultimate source 01 these heresies was to be found there; ·
a mistake due probably to the comments of Averroes, with
which the first translations of these works into Latin were
accompanied ¹.

How to deal with the problem 01 matter so as to give 00
couuteuance to pantheistic error, was therefore an urgent and
momentous question, to which the schoolmen 01 the thirteenth
century, and Albert especially, devoted their full powers.
