tinguishes the propagation of light from that of sormds or odours.
But the distinction is of degree ; light being more subtle, its motion

is more rapid .......... 526-528
Alkindi urges that, though through short distances the transit of
light may be imperceptible to our senses, yet that the summation of
short periods would amount, in the transit from east to west, to some-
thing that would be perceptible. Eut of imperceptibility there are
many degrees; and the propagation of light is so rapid that the
summation of a vast number of imperceptible periods may still not
ruach the point at which perception of time by human sense is

possible ............ 528
ltis further maintained that in radiation of speciesas heredescribed,

more time would be occupied than in translation of a body through
space: because between the formation of any one species and the

formation of that which follows it, there is an interval of rest. The
fact is, however, that the resistance of the medium to a body carried
through it would be far greater than it would be to the formation
of species, which involves an exceedingly slight disturhance of the
medium ; so that the motion in this latter case will be far more rapid,
aad the interposition of intervals of rest will pass unperceived . 528-529

CHAPTER 1.

ln propagatiou of species we have to consider, first, that which we
call ianiarent, as when light makes light3 secondly, the equivocal, as
when light makes hear, or any other effect of a different kind As to
the first. we remark that the strongest are those which proceed by
direct lines, as contrasted with those which are refracted or reflected.
We may omit for the present those which proceed on tortuous paths,
as in the case of nervous action; since here a different agency‚ that
of life, comes into play. The species called accidental, i.e. which
proceed, not directly frorn the object, but secondarilyfrom the species,
arethe feehlest of all ......... 530-534

CHAPTER ll.

The path of some species falls perpendicularly on the object 3 these
are the strongest3 and this whether the object be aplane surface or
curved ln either case the angles made are equab That which
impinges on the conwex surface of a sphere, is stronger than that
which falls on the concere surface as being necessarily shorter. The
