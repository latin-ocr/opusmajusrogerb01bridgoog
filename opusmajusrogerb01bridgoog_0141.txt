straight path. in this case a ray falling on the right side of the lens
would pass backwards to the lest of the eye, and conversely. Con·
fusion as to right and left would thus result. But, the vitreous being
denset, the rays leaving the lens are refracted; and as the diagram
shows, they converge inaway which avoids this confusion. . 47-49

CHAPTER 11.

The action of the eye on the object seen. Like every other object,
the eye radiates species. But are these radiationis, or those of them
which touch the object, necessary to visioni Aristotle's remarks in
his treatise on Generation seem to point to this. Ptolemy and
subsequent optical writers have asserted it. Plato maintained that
sensation was wholly active; the Stoics that it was wholly passive.
Aristotle takes a medium course. Vision is in fact not merely
passive, but active .......... 49-50

CHAPTER 111.

Nor do Alhaaen, Avicenna, and Aves-roes contest this view. They
only protest against the notion that the eye emits some material
substance to the thing seen. Α passage in Aristotle (De Animaii.
rai has been understood as though he looked on sensation as wholly

passive. But it was only by way ol protest against the Platonists, who
went too far in the opposite direction ...... stt-52

CHAPTER lV.

As all objects in nature complete their action by emitting their own
special forces, so does the eye generate rays from itself. These meet
the rays proceeding from the object to the eye, and facilitate the
passage of these latter. As they are of different nature no confusion
arises from their meeting ........ 52-53

The first condition is Light. Without light, colour either (a) does
not exist, or (l) sends out no emanations, or (c) what emanations it
produces do not affect vision. The third of these explanations is the
true one The second condition is, Distance of the object. An object
placed in immediate contact with the organ of sense is not perceived:
for the organ acts by emitting force from itself into the medium.
This is the case even with the sensas of touch and taste. The

medium for these is the flesh and slrin surrounding the sense
organs ............ 5456
