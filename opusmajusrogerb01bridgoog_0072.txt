necessity, no infallibility, in their predictions os contingent
events. . . . What they do is to consider the way in which the
body may be affected by celestial things, and the way in
which the body may act upon the mind in private affairs or
public, always ⁴without prejudice to the lreedom ol the will.
For although the reasonable soul is not coerced to any luture
actions, yet it Δ, may be strongly stirred and induced, so as
sreely to will those things towards which celestial force may

There are perhaps lew fictitious creeds lor the origin os

rather in that ol invisible but manlike gods, astrology would
be an easy and almost inevitable deduction from their creed.
The immense majority ol the Asiatic population, whether
Semitic or Mongol‚ were, unlike the Indians and the Greeks,
not polytheists but astrolaters. When the Arabs received
and enlarged their inheritance of Ptolemaic astronomy, their
astrologic beliefs, lar lrom being dissipated‚ were strongly
confirmed. Ol the seven wanderers ol the sky, the influence
on earthly things ol two, the Sun and the M00n‚ was too
