BACON'S LIFE. xxiii

be divided into two periods, apparently of nearly equal length ;
the periods before and after his admission into the Franciscan
Order. ln the seventeenth chapter of the Opus Tertium he
speaks of having devoted more than twenty years to the study
ol languages and of science. ‘ 1 sought,' he says, ‘the friend-
ship of all wise men among the Latins3 and Ι caused young
men to be trained in languages‚ in geometrical figures, in
numbers, in the construction of tables‚ in the use of instru-
ments, and in many other necessary things. ..During this
time [spent more than two thousand pounds in those things
and in the purchase of books and instruments.’ We may
presume that the pounds were French, which at that time
would correspond to between 600 and 700 pounds sterling.
The sum was a large one. And whether large or small, it
would be quite incompatible with the profession of an Order
specially devoted to poverty. It may be inferred, therefore,
that since he had studied independently 'for some twenty
years, it was not till some time between 1245 and 1250 that
Bacon became a Franciscan.

Among the men distinguished for their learning whose
friendship he cultivated at this part of his career may be
counted‚ in all probability, Adam de Matisco, Edmund Rich,
afterwards Archbishop of Canterburyand ultimatelycanonized;
Thomas Bungay, whose name was one day to be associated
with his own as a worker of magic; Thomas, Bishop of
St. David3 John of Basingstoke, scholar and traveller; John
Peckham, afterwards Archbishop ol Canterbury; Hermann,
one of the principal translators of Aristotle3 Shirwood, the
treasurer of Lincoln; and last and greatest, the illustrious
Bishop of Lincoln, Robert Grosseteste. ln Bacon’s earlier
years of study, Grosseteste had not plunged into the arduous
and absorbing work of his episcopate. Novit scientias, Bacon
says of him. He was rector scholarum, and also Chancellor
of Oxford. and in 1224 was the rector ol the Franciscans
recently established there. The terms in which Bacon bears
testimony to his encouragement of philology, to his attempts
to apply mathematical method to the study of physical
phenomena, to his disregard of the philosophy of the schools
