have lost their way. These can be set right by natives of the plane.
But io life it is·the broadest and most trodden road that leads
farthest astray. We must leave the crowd if we would go right. We
must look within3 the mind must be a lnw to itself Nature must be
our guide. lf our mind is attuned to nature it will not fail us. We
shall thus substitute for the distractione of pleasure and fortune the
joy and tranquillity of inward peace. He is to be called truly blessed
to whom the only good or evil is good or evil of the soul, the only
pleasure, to be free from slavery to pleasure. Virtue is undying,
pleasure perishes in the act of fruition. Pleasure may be the lot of
good men and of bad: hut for the good it is a servant, not a master3
they are undisturhed by its absence; like the universe, like the
Deity, they retain self·mastery. They live and act without strife,
without vacillation, in inward harmony and peace. Yet virtue is not
to be sought for the joy that it brings, any more than fields are tilled
for the flowers that may spring up amidst the corn. lt is an end in
itself; there is nothing beyond it. With vicious pleasure virtue is
incompatible. Lawful pleasures it accepts, as using but not abusing
them. Unless raised above them, the wise man could not withstand
the trials of life Pleasure is hut an addition to his life, not the
govemingprinciple. To confound these things, to regard pleasure and
virtue as inseparable, is a fatal error, leading inevitably to the triumph
of the haser clement. There must be uo compromise The highest ,
good ceases to be the highest if mixed with something alien to itself.
The very foundation of virtue is undermined when it is made to
depend on outward circumstance. lt will no longer inspire deeds of
heroism and self-sacrifice. ll’hen such are called for, they will be
done unwillingly, and not with the prompt obedieoce of the faithful
soldier. The reward of our fidelity is true freedom. Nothing canbe
done to us against our will, for our will is at one with that of God.
But who, it may he asked, comes up to this standard? whose life is
not utterly inconsistent with it? Admit this, and yet we need not be
deterred from aiming at it. lt is best to have high aims. lf we
resolve to be fearless in the presence of death, not to be the slaves of
fortune, to aclmowledge our bond to our follow-men, to act when
alone as though the world beheld us, to set restraint on appetite, to
bow in all things before God’s will, we areat least on the upward
path,though we may not attalo. Those who scoti at us will profit little.
A man may he wealthy and prosperous, yet good. He may use his
wealth to relieve the needy or to support the state. He will not
throw it away; yet, if it be taken from him he will be content. The
difference between him and others is¹ that bis riches belong to him.
they belong to their riches. lf innocently gained they cause him
