De Vita Beata, and De Tranquillitate Animi, from which Bacon
has quoted so largely.
The fourth section oi the Moral Philosophy contains the

v ⁸¹ r, , first attempt ever made at the comparative study oi the
¹ 'religions ol the world. These Bacon tanges in six classes:

Pagans, Idolaters, Tartars, Saracens, Jews, Christiana What
specially called attention to this subject in Racon’s time were
the events proceeding in Central Asia, and already seriously
affecting European politics. Mongol bordes had swept over
Russia and South Eastern Europe, and were threatening the
Western kingdoms. Franciscan and Dominican missionaries
had been sent by Pope innocent lV and by Louis IX to
investigate the danger at its source. The reports brought
back by these missionaries, especially those os Carpini and

the leaders ol the Church in all its magnitude. It was seen
that beyond the Christian world, beyond the Mahommedan

One os these was Buddhism, recently imported into Central
Asia from Tibet‚ with its elaborate monastic system, its image·
worship, and its complicated liturgy. This creed was always
spoken oi by Rubruquis and Carpini‚ as by Marco Polo in
the succeeding generation, as Idolatry. Christianity of the

seem, in its most highly militant sorm. Side by side with
these were tribes whose religion was ol' a lower grade‚ not
rising above the rudest setichism3 these were spoken oi as

and the extreme East, would cease to be a danger. The
issue remained undecided in Bacon’s tirne. But we can
imagine with what interest he would conier‚.as he tells us
that he did, with Rubruquis on his return to Paris, an'd
