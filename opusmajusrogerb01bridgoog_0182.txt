(a) As to the nume and the essential meaning of species.

By species is here ineant the first effect osany natural agent. Thus
light passing through space is the species ol the light in the sun.

substance and accident. But, although ol the sarm nature, its
estense is incomplete; just as we should say ol the embryo, only
that the incompleteness is lar greater. Some egents produce more
complete species than others, as light, colour, beat Generally

their species .......... 410-413

(b) There can be only one such resembling effect for each egent.
This we oell univocal; the multiple secondary effecte may be oalled

takes the name ol the agent. F ire, when it has taken hold ol the
