character than the mother, and acts accordingly. So it is with God.
Those whom lle loves He chastens, lest through ease and comfort
their forces should decay. There can be no proof of heroism except
wrestling with calamity, therefore those are to be pitied who have no
such trial of their force. A breve man is proud that his general sends
him to the post of danger. The sailor‚ the ploughman, are hardened
by their calling: audit is so with character. Brave men face their
trialswillingly, andare purified by them as gold in the fumace.
Thus the true blessings of life are given3 the false appearance of

CHAPTER Xl.

Seneca proves further that the wise man cannot sustain injury or
insuit. That he will be attached is certain, but he will not give way
to attach: it will not injure him 3 he will beas asbestos in the flame
or rocks in the sea-foam. We may distinguish lnjury from insuit:
the former being the graver, though the latter is often more dreaded.
The injurer sceks to inflict hurt. But for the wise man there is no

on them as trials oi his strength lnsult is a smaller matter, to be
complained of rather than avenged. lt implies some mistrust in the
recipient of his own worth, from which a wise man would be free.
We are not to suppose him insensible. Bodily pain, the loss of friends,
political disaster, he will feel like other men: but of mere insuit he
will be simply unconscious, or will treat it as a passing dream. He
will not take offence at it any more than a mother at the petulance
of her child. For those who would insult him are but grown-up
children. lf he restrains and punishes them, it is not because himself
