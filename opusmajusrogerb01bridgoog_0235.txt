¹ This passage deals with one ol the most important ol mediaeval contro-
versies in which Aquinas was at issue with Averroes and his Arabian pre·
decessors. lhese maintained the existence os an universal reason, ol which
individuale were more or less the partalrers. Aquinas refutes this view in
S. T, Pars 1, Quaest. lxxvi. Art. a: ‘Utrum intellectivum principium multipli-
cetur secundum multiplicationem corporum.’ See also his systematic treatise,
De Unitate Intellectus. lt will be seen that Bacon in this passage appears to
side with the Arabians against St. Thomas. cl. also the correspondlng passage
in Opus Tertium, capua But in his more elaborate treatment ol the subject in
Communia Naturalium (unpublished), Pars iv. cap. 14, he is caresul to distin·
guish his doctrine from that ol Averroes. That there should be a divine light
pervading the world, was one thing: that the intellect ol mankind should be
one and the sarm substance, was quite another thesis which cut at the root
ol morality. Renan (Averroes, p. 71 etseq.) shows that, though the doctrine ι
attached by St. Thomas is commonly identified with Averroes, it had been
held by Alkindi, Altarabl, and Avicenna centurias before. lt'may be noted,
in passing, that Jebb’s error in writing repeatedly sistemus lor intellectus has
gone sar to make this passage unintelligible.

Aristotlc can hardly be called as a witness tor the Arabian side ol the contro-
versy, though his distinction between intellect and the other physical lacul-
ties is os course emphatic enough. Cf. De Anima, iii. 4, ᾗ 5 τὸ μὲν γάρ
αἰσθητικὸν οὐκ ἄνευ σώματος, ά δὲ (νοῦς) χωριστόν. Again, ii. a, §9 τοῦτο μόνον
ἐνδέχεται χωρίζεσθαι, καθάπερ τὸ άῒάιον τοῦ φθαρτοῦ. The passage ol the transla-
tion ot which Bacon complains is De Ammo, iiis lul t· ὥσπερ ἓν ἁπάσῃ τῇ
φύσει ἐστι’ τιτὸ μὲν ὕλη ἑκάστῳ γάνει (τοῦτο δ’ὁ πάντα δυνάμει ἐκεῖνα), ἕτερον δὲ
τά αἴτιον nol ποιητικὸν τῷ ποιεῖν πάντα, οἷον ἡ τέχνη πρὸς τὴνῧληνιὲπονθον, ἀνάγκη
καὶ ir τῇ ulmi ὑπάρχειν τούτοις rds διαφοράν.
