accordance with the fifth rule. li it be the half of a sphere or more
than the half, then the centre of the sphere will be between the eye
and the object and the magnifying effect will be less A candle
however held at a moderate distance will appear larger than it
placed nearer, because the refracted rays from the extremity of the
object are taken for direct rays. Moreover‚ rays from the nearer
position are apt to dazzle a wealr vision and thus are neutralized.
- From a somewhat more distant position they are better appreciated.
These are a few illustratione of the effects oi refraction. They are
not intended as an exhaustive treatment of the subject. . . tta-159

CHAPTER 1.

All these scientific truths have aspiritual signification. The prayer,
Guard us as the pupil of thine eye, cannot be understood without
knowledge of the structure ol the eye and the pupil Each of the
structores by which the pupil is defended has an allegorical
meaning ........... 159-161

charran 11.

As in vision we should neither be too far from the object nor too
near, so for spiritual vision we should neither be too far from God,
nor too presumptuously near. Vision is by sense, by memory,
and by reasoning; this may be paralleled in spiritual vision. Vision
is direct, refracted, or reflected: spiritually the tirst is divine, the
second angelic, the third human. Or, again, the first is the perfect
vision after the resurrection3 the second, before resurrection and after
death3 the third, the imperfect vision ol lifeon earth . . 161-163

CHAPTER Ill.

On the practica] application of this science there is much to be
said. By reflexion we can multiply the images of objects at will,
as by natural mirrors formed by vapours in the sky the image of
the sun and moon are multiplied. Mirrors may be erected in
elevated positione which may reveal the details of an enemy’s camp,

as is said to have been done by Caesar from the coast of Gaul when
about to invade Britain . . . ⁴ ..... 164165
