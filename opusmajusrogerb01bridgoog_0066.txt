os arithmetic. The section on practical or applied geometry
isos much interest as illustrating Bacon's enlarged views ol
scientihc training. He indicates eight departments ol this
branchos science. (1) Agriculture‚ in a iar wider sense than
is usually given to the word, comprising mensuration, archi-
tecture, civil, mechanical‚ and military engineering. (2) The
fabrication oi astronomical instrumenta (3) of musical in·
strumenta (4) Os optical instrumenta (5) Ol barological
instruments. (6) Ol instruments oi experimental science.
(7) Ol medical and surgical appliances. (8) Oi chemical
apparatus.

In connexion with the practical branchos arithmetic, aiter
speaking ol the use ol the AbacuS, he mentions ‘vias algorithmi,
scilicet quomodo conjugantur numeri et dividuntur, secunddm
omnem speciem algorithrni‚ tarn in particularibus fractionibus
quarn in integris! ln this connexion he speaks oi ‘Algebra
quae est negotiatio, et almochabala quae est census.¹ How
sar Bacon had assimilated the work ol Mohammed ben Musa¹‚
whose surname, Al Chwarismi, is incorporated in the word
Algorithm, we cannot tell. But with the work os one os the
two great mathematicians ol the thirteenth century, Jordanus
Nemorarius, hc was certainly familiar, as may be seen by
reference to vol. i. pp. 158, 169 ol the Opus Majus. Among
other branches oi practical arithmetic he includes the con·
struction of astronomical tables, mensuration, alloys and
coinage, partnership‚ and other operations ol commerce.
These things are treated os at great length in the liber
Abaci os Leonard ol Pisa, tlte other great mathematician
os the time, whose work, dedicated to Michael Scot, Bacon

¹ lluhamrued ibn Musa Alchwarismi was born in the first quarter os the ninth
centtwy. lle constructed astronomical tables ior the Caliph Al Mamoun, which
were translated into Latin by Adelard ol Bath. Oi more importance, however,
are his Arithmetic and his Algebra The first ol these remained lora long time
unknown. But it was discovered in Cambridge in 1857, and is included among
the Tmttatr' Marmarica published by Bonconrpagni. Α lull account ol this
work and ol the Algebra, translated and edited by Rosen (Loacus, 1831), will
bc found in Cantor, vol. i. pp. 611-629. Cantor (ρ. 612) explains clearly the
passage ol the word Alchwarismi into Algorithm. Bacon's interpretation ol the
words Aldschebr walmukabala, which Alchwarismi uses, is incorrect. Dschebr
means Restoration, mukabala means opposition.
