prejudiee ‚against mathematice was strengthened hythe strile ol
heathenism⁴ against Christianity, in which magic was used by the
former, and in which Christian miracles were accounted lor by magic.
The reproaches denying free-will remaiued, when the suspicion ol
magic had passed away. But examination oi Ptolemy¹s works shows ·

by astronomy indicated general tendencies only, and did not impose 2
any specific compulsion on individnal actions. But this distinction
