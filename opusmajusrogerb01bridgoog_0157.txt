EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE ...... 167—222

CHAPTER l.

Having laid down the general principles ol wisdom so iar as they
are found in language, in mathematics, and in optics‚ l pass to the
subject ol experimental science. Tbere are two modes os acquiring
knowledge—reasoning and experience. Reasoning guides us to
a soond conclusion, but does not remove doubt from the mind until
confirmed by experience. A man who has never seen lire may read
the prooss that lire burns, hut will not be satisfied ol it till he has been
bumt. Even in geometry the demonstration of the first proposition
ol Euclid lails to carry conviction till the ligure has been inspected.
When Aristotle speaks oi knowledge ol the cause as a higher kind
ol knowledge than that gained by experience‚ he is speaking ol mere
empiric knowledge of a fact3 I am speaking ol experimenta] know·

the absence ol experiment‚ and wholly salse, such as that adamant
can be broken by goats’ blood, that the beaver when chased throws
away his testicles, that a vessel. ol hot water freezes more rapidly
than one ol cold‚ and soon. Experience isos two kinds: (ι) that in
which we use our bodily scnses aided by instruments, and by
evidence ol trustworthy witnesses; and (2) internal experience ol
things spiritual, which comesos grace, and which osten leads to
knowledge οἱ earthly things. The mind stained with vice is like
a rusly or uneven mirr0r‚ in which things seem other than they are.
Without virtue a man may repeat words like a parrot, and imitate
other men's wisdom like an ape, and all to no purpose. The in·
tellectual effect of a stainlcss lile is well illustrated in the young man
who is the bearer os this treatise. The degrees ol spiritual experience
are seven. (r) Spiritual illumination3 (2) virtue; (3) the gift of the
Holy Spirit described by lsaiah3 (4) the Beatitudes; (5) spiritual
sensibility3 (6) Fruits, such as the peace of God which passes
understanding3 (7) states os Rapture ..... lot-172
