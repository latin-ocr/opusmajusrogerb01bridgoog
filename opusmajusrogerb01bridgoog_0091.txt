lxxxii INTRODUCTION.

We are here brought sace to sace with the failure‚ and the
cause ol the lailure, ol Bacon's social and political ideal. He
was aiming at au enlarged and renovated Catholicism which
should bind together and incorporate all that was best and
noblest in Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic tradition in the fabric
ol the Christian Church, sor the spiritual govemment os the
world. The keystone ol the fabric was supplied by the
mistress-science, theology, resting on Mosaic and Christian
revelation, consolidated by Aristotelian philosophy, and
penetrated by the vital and progressive spirit os natural
science. A progressive papacy, carrying on in continuous
and harmonious development the work which Mosaic law and
Greek intellect had begun-such was Bacon’s vision: and the
marvellous upheaval ol thought in Paris and elsewhere during
the thirteenth century seemed to bring that vision within reach
os sulfilment.

But while Paris was building up its systems os philosophie
theology, south ot' the Alps, irt the rival university os Bologna,
work os another kind was going on. The study of the civil law
os Rome, which had never wholly ceased in the cities os North

Italy, had been stimulated early in the twelsth century by the
teaching os Irnerius and others; and t'rom that teaching the

university os Bologna gradually arose, as the university ol
Paris had arisen srom the teaching ot' Abelard. It was
a momentous event in the history os Europe. civit law was
a study as secular as the Roman empire itsels. Clerical and
lay students sat at the lectures side by side ‘Very early in
the twelfth century men ol mature age, men os good birth and
good position, beneficed and dignified ecclesiastica, or sons os
nobles, flocked from the remotest parts os Europe to the
lecture-roomo ol Bologna' (Rashdall, History of Universitien
i. 124). The civil law embraced the entire system os man's
social relations, and dealt with them on principles with which
theology had no concern.

. The Church sert the danger, and coped with it in the only

part ol the Momlr's Philosophia. But his language on the subject does not
332: theslpeliel th'et the subject was lully dealt with Cf. Op. Tert. cap. xiv.
