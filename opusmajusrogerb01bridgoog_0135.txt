cxxvi ANALl'SIS OF THE ‘OPUS MAIUS?

CHAPTER 111.
voa. tt. taces

The attributes, or properties, of which sense takes cognizance may
be reduced to twenty-nine heads. Nine of these are apprehended
by some special sense, as colour by sight, beat by touch, sound by
hearing. The other twenty may be called sensibilia communia,
because apprehended by all, or by more than one, of the special κω.
Distanoe, position, figure, number, motion, rest, areamong these . 5-7

CHAPTER lV.

But animala, though they have not intellect, have other faculties
than those implied in the apprehension of these twenty-nine pro·
perties. First there is the instinct prompting ssight from an animal
of a dangerous species, or approach to one of its own, independently
of experience Each object in nature has its own constitution or
complexim, and radiates corresponding impressions (species) which
concur with those of like complexim, or disagree with those of unlilre.
They operate on special and on common sense, but are talren
cognitance of by a higher faculty of the sensitive soul, which we may
call the estimative sense, and may locate in the posterior cell of the
brein. But as in the case of sensus communis, it does not retain its
impressione, and needs another faculty acting as its storehouse‚ the
memorative faculty. Midway between these two divisione or cells of
the brain is the cell devoted to the cogitative faculty, the mistress
faculty in brutes which have not true reason. By this faculty the
spider weaves its web, the bird its nest. ln man the rational soul,
coming from without, uses this cogitative faculty as its chief in·

CHAPTER V.

That we do not find this view of the threefold division of the brein
and of animal faculty in Aristotle is due to imperfect translation.
lt can be got from Avicenna, who hasbeen better translated And
Avicenna is the greatest philosopher since Aristotle. ln any case
it will not do to confound the faculty which stores sensatione with the
faculty which stores judgements, under the common name ot' memory.
lt must further be stated that while placing these faculties in the
brain, the substance of the brain is not itself sensitiva, as Avicenna
points out, respectfully correcting Aristotle on this point. We must
remetnber however that the sensitiva soul has a twofold urgan-the
hrain and the beart The latter is the true seat of all life, as
Aristotle maintains: the former is that which first receives irn-
pressions and in which the various operatione of the censes are

separatetymanitested ......... tlt
