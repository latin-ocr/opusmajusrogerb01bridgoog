lxx INTRODUCTION.

made with the surface on each side were equal. He con-
ceived the assemblage of rays as a cone having its apex in the
eye, and its base in the boundary ol the object seen: that the
apparent magnitude of the object depended on the magnitude
ol the angle ol the cone. Thence followed the ordinary prin·
ciples ol perspective, as that ol equal magnitudes at unequal
distances3 those nearer to the eye appeared larger‚ and so on.
In the Catoptrica (attributed to Euclid, but probably due to
Theon), lrom the equality ol the angles ol reflexion and inci·
dence in plane mirrors was deduced the convergence of rays
falling on a concave speculum.

Ptolemy¹ carried the science much further than Euclid. To
the study ol reflected light he added that ol' refraction. The
chief interest of his work lies in the application to the subject
ol the experimental method, an instance ol it unique, il we ex-
cept the Pythagorean experiments in acoustics, in the history
ol Greek science. Using an extremely simple but ingenious
apparatus, he discovered, not merely that the luminous
ray in passing lrom one medium to another was deflected‚
but, within certain limus, he ascertained the amount ol de-
flexion and its dependence on two distinct factors, the angle
os incidence‚ and the nature of the two media concemed.
Ptolemy distinctly describes and explains the error introduced
by refraction into astronomical observations. The lact that
in his great astronomical treatise there is no mention ol refrac-
tion had led to the conclusion that the Almagest and the
Optics must be attributed to distinct authors. The Ophis,
however, may be a later work. We know it only from a trans·
lation from the Arabic into Latin, made in the twelith century3
it has been recently edited by Gilbcrto Govi, of Turin. The
researches of Euclid, Ptolemy, and others on Optics, engaged
the attention ol the Arabian schools from an early period.

¹ On Ptolemy's Oph'cs therela a very interesting chapter in Delambre'a
Astronomr'e Ano'enne, vol. ii. pp. 411·43o, ed. 1817. (See also a note on p. li ol
Prelace to vol. i which modilies some os his conclusione.) All our knowledge
ol Ptolemy's optical work comes from an imperfect Latin translation from the
Ambic made in the twellth century by Admiral Eugenius ol Sicily. There are
late MSS. ot' this work in Paris and in the Bodleian Library. But Govi's
recent edition is from a much older MS. in the Ambrosian Library ot' ldilan.
