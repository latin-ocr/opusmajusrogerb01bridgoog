BACON'S LIFE. xxxi

¹ 'The storin of indignation had long been gathering: and iu

1277 it broke. In that year jerome d'Ascoli, who four years
before had succeeded Bonaventura as General of the Franciscan
Order‚ held a chapter in Paris. Bacon was summoned on
account os ‘certain suspected novelties.’ He was condemned,
and thrown into prison. What were the ‘novelties’ that
constituted his crime we do not know. His works abounded
in them. lt was not perhaps difficult to show that he had
gone too far in connecting changes in religious saith with
conjunctions of Jupiter and Mercury3 and in hinting that
underneath the jugglery of the magicians‚ valuable truths
might sometimes lie concealed. The real motives for stilling

That he should have held the history of Greek philosophy

worldly knowledge. Alexander of Hales had joined the
brotherhood before the death of St. Francis, and had
dominated the schools of Paris long before the voice of
Albert had been heard there, and while Aquinas was a child.
To a man of ordinary temper, addicted to bold speculation,
the protection of so powerful a corporation as the Francis-
cans had become when Bacon joined them would have been
invaluable. But Bacon threw his chauces away. He attacked
the celebrities of his own Order as severely as those of its
rival. llis fiery and impatient spirit was to be bound by no
shackles of prudence. He had come to Paris fresh from the
teaching of rnen like Grosseteste, eager for the promotion
