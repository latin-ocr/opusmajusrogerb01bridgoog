cx ANALYSIS OF THE ‘OPUS MAJUS?

vor.. r. raons
All these, apert from their literal importance, have a distinct spiritual
signification. The river symbolizes the world; the Dead Sea, hell;

Jericho, the flesh; the Mount of Olives, spiritual lise; the vailey of
Jehoshaphat, humility3 Jerusalem, the soul in the enjoyment oi
peace, or again the Church militant and triumphant. Minute
research will reveal numberlessintermediatemeanings . . 183-187

The third head relates to sacred chronology. scripture presents
to us a succession ol times, with regard to which precise knowledge
can only be given by mathematical astronomy. Τ he waning-point
is the creation oi the world. Was this in the autumnal or the vernal
equinos? From what is said in the Old Testament as to the Feast
of lngathering [Exodus xxiii. 16] we should inser the former. Yet
Jewish and Christian commentators adopt the latter view. lt will be
ior astronomy to decide this difficult point. Further, the question os
the longevity of the ancient patriarchs has to be considered. One
mode of accounting lor it may be the more favourable position ol tbe
sun and the planets in primitive times. Again there is the problem
of the Deluge. The right interpretation oi Josephus points to
November as the month rn which rt began. Lastly, did night come
before day, or the converse? The former would seem to be the true
view ............ 187-195

The fourth head deals not with chronology in general, but with
the definition os periods. How is the beginning oi a lunation
to'be lixedl by astronomical caladation, or by the moment when the
new moon is visible? The actual lunation is variable. The average ,
lunation must be used. The Jews use the Metonic cycle of nineteen
years, or 235 lunatione. This gives twenty-nine days, twelve hours,
and 1⁷⁶ng osan hour sor the mean lunation. They talre a period oi thir·
teen lunar cycles or 247 years, within which all their festivals recur at
the same moment. The lunation is considered to begin with the sun·
set immediately following the computed time. These oonsiderations

nray be applied to the date of the Creation, of N oah's issue from the
ark, ol the Passover‚ and finally ol the Passion. The current belief

in the Latin Church is that Christ was born in the second year oi
a lunar cycle. and died on March 25 (a dviii Kal Aprilis, the moon
being at the fifteenth day (the Greeks holding that it was the
sourteenth day). Against this much may be urged. lt implies that
it was in the thirteenth year ol a cycle. From the computationoi
S. Dionysius this would involve the Passion taking place on a Sunday‚
which is impossible. Atable is appended showing one solution oi the
difficulty. This would show the date ol the Passion to be April 3
l a. d. iii N ou. Aprilis), on the fifteenrh year oi the lunar cyclo, Christ
being then thirty-two years old This view is offered to the Pope lor
consideration .......... 195-210
