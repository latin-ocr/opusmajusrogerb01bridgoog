cxxx ANALYSIS OF THE ‘OPUS MAJUSJ

CHAPTER ll.
vor„ rr. raoss

Vision is not completcd in the eye, but in the commissure of the
optic nerves within the hrain. Here the impressions coming from
each eye coincide‚ so that the object is seen as single. lf one of the
eyes be forcibly misplaced, this coincidence does not taire place, and
the impression of duality is produced ...... tte-33

The terminal point of the visual process would seem to be the
optic commissum: in the same way as the olfactory bulbs terminate
the olfactory process. This in no way conflicts with what hasbeen
said as to the location of sensus communis. We are here speaking of
special sensations. The function of vision then is partially carried
on within the eye3 and is completed in the point of junction of the
optic nerves ........... 33-34

CHAPTER l.

Α difficulty is suggested by the smallness of the pupil. Although
eones of rays come from every part of the object to every part of the
ocular surface, yet we need only consider for practioel purposes one
cone, made up of those rays which are normal to this surface. As
to the oblique rays we shall see afterwards. Now it can easily be
shown by geometry that from the base of a triangle, however large,
any number of lines can be drawn to the vertex, which will all pass
through any line subtending the base however short Matter is
infinitely divisible: as many divisions can be made in a grain of ·
millet as in the diameter of the world ..... 35-37

But independently of the cone whose rays fall perpendicularly on
the eye, there is an infinity of others whose rays fall obliquely. lt
would seem that confusion must result. The explanation is that the
perpendicular rays come with much greater force, and obscure
the effect of the others, as the sun’s light conceals the light of the
stars. lt has further to be observed that of these oblique rays many
are made to converge by refraction with those which fall per·
pendicularly on the central part of the eye. There are thus various
degrees in vision. The central rays and those which converge with
themate seen weil: some rays result in imperfect vision; some in ·
none at all ........... 37-39
