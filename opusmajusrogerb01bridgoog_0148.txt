consisting ol a multitude oi small stars clustered, produces the

erroneous impression ol a continuous light3 this is due only to
distance. This luminous impression is caused by the passage oi
rays lrom these small stars through the sphere ot' lire; the medium
in the stellar spaces would be too rare, that ot' the sphere of air too
dense We have also to talre into account the refraction of rays in
the sphere os fire3 but oi this allerwards The light ol dawn raises ·
. aquestion. Why do we not see it earlier? Why, since outside the
earth’s sbadow the whole sky is illumined, does the sky appear darlr
· to usl The reply is, first, that the spheres of heaven are very
distant 3 also that the heaven, apart from th'e dense bodies contained
in it, is too rare to have fixed ligbt; light passas through it without
affecting the eye. When the sun's rays touch that portion ot' air
which is comparatively near to us, this illuminated air becomes per·
ceptible. lt nray happen that a luminous body ol small magnitude
appears lar larger than it is on account oi rapid motion. Sparlrs
{rom a fire produce this effect. Shooting stars are probably bodies
oi small magnitude. Colour,lilre light, is apprehended by pure sense3
and correct apprehension ol it depends on the conditions before men·
tioned. Extreme transparency oi the object, great intensity of the
colour, too great remoteness ot' it, rapid suocession ol different
colours, will intersere with accurate perception. . . . 99—104

CHAPTER ΙΙ.

Ol Perception through knowledge (recollection). Under this head
are to be classed distinctionsoi characters, whether general or special,
in visible things. The moon¹s light outside the earth's shadow is
clear and white, in the upper part ol the shadow red, in the lower
part is invisible. These differences, though perceived by sight, become
known to us only alter repeated observation. The explanation is not
easy. The moon’s light, lilre that ol other stare, comes from the sun.
When the moon is in conjunction, the hindrance to illumination of
the part oi the moon turned tous is the moon itseli; the solat rays
diverge widely on either side, and do not reach us, even secondarily,
by dispersion But when the moon is in the earth’s shadow, the earth
being distant from the moon, the moon is near the vertex oi the cone,
and accidental solar rays entering within it produce the reddish light
seen in a lunar edipse The degree ol this light will vary with the
distance ol the moon lrom the earth at tlre time os edipse, which may
be greater or less. Another problem, raising a similar difficulty,
occurs with colour. ll we look through a very thin piece oi parti·
coloured cloth at 'an object of given colour, we may see that colour if

the apertures in the weh are large enough; is otherwise, we see
a mixed colour. The quality ol the medium will modity the result.
