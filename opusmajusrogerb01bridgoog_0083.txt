ture of the lens, enables rays from near objects to be accurately
focussed, were unknown to him. But this is only to say that
he had not anticipated the physiologica! knowledge of the
nineteenth century.

It must always be bome in mind that, in Bacon's view, the
radiation os light through space did not stand alone. lt was
a type of other radiantactivities, such as colour (then supposed
to be distinct lrom, though dependent on, light), heat, sound‚
and odour. (With regard to sound‚ however, certain reserves
were made.) 1t is interesting to note Bacon’s handling os an
important problem, not to be solved but by a more potent
calculus than any in his possession, how these various actions,
crossing one another’s paths in their passage through space,
retained their distinctness ¹.

It will be remembered that among the various branches of

knowledge regarded by Bacon as falling under the head
oi Physics, was Barology (Scicntiu ponderum). The treatise
oi Jordanus Nemorarius‚ Dc Ponderibus, to which reference is
made, vol. i. p. 169, had perhaps suggested the treatment oi
the phenomena of gravity as a distinct branch oi science.
No treatise by Bacon upon this subject, so far as I am aware,
is extant3 and the lew remarks in the fourth section os the
Opus Majus (pp. 167-174) contain all that we know ol his
speculations on the theory ol gravitation.

Nor is anything known to usos the way in which Bacon
treated, is indeed he ever attempted, the science which he
called ‘Agricultura' which, as we have seen, was intended to
include the study oi living bodieS, vegetable and animal.
But the case is otherwise with the science regarded by him
as preparatory to the study of lile, ‘Alkimia Speculativa.' On
the subject of Alchemy, very little is said in the Opus Marsus,
and the omission was supplied in the provisional way, which
alone was possible under the hurry oi compilation to satisly
Pope Clement's orders, by the Opus Minus, the first ol the
