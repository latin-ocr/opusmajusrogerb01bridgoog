produced. Again, while we are valking at night in any direction,
a star to the right os us will seem to move with us, since it holds
very nearly the same position relatively to us at the end of our
passage as at the beginning: the star being lar off, the difference
made by our change of place is imperceptible. When the sun is
on the meridien, a long line os men extending from east to west will
all see him directly in sront and the shadows oi their bodies will
appear parallel3 the divergence of the shadows is too small to be
perceptible· The motionol the planets is imperceptible hy direct
inspection. Rapid motion in a circle, followed by rest, gives the
sensation of movemeut in surrounding objects. In this case when
the man stands still, the humours os the eye still continue in motion.

CHAPTER Vll.

One uf the most difficult problems is that ol the scintillation oi the
fixed stars Aristotle remarks their contrast in this respect with the
planels, and attributes it to their greater distance; the eye, being
more strained, is tremulous. scintillation is different from the tremor

sometimes seen in the sun and other planets at rising and setting.
li distance were the sole explanation, we should expect Saturn to
scintillate, which it does not. Further, it is only the larger os the
lixed stars that do so. Therelore strength os light must be a condi·
tion. And yet, since the sun at noon does not scintillate, the light
must not be too strong. One ol the cartses would seem to be the
internal strain ol the eye at very distant objects. The planetary
bodies are easily perceived to be near, and with them there is no
strain. Moreover, the fact of extreme distance os itsels weakens the
visual rays. lt may be objected that the strain is greater in the case
of small stars than ol large: but here the condition oi sufficientiy
strong light is wanting. Again, it is objected that il ocular strain
be one ol the factore, this depends upon each observer’s choioe and
will. But this is not so. lt is one ol those actions which have
become involuntary through habit But how is this difference
oi distance between the planels and the stars to be known? lts
quantity doubtless is not known. But the lact that there is a
differeuce is a matter os sensation. Has the density, or has the
motion ol the medium, anything to do with scintillationi Perhaps
both contribute, as Averroes has suggested; and perhaps also at
these immense distances the visual power is exhausted, and acting
only intermittently, produces the tremulous impressiou. By motion
ol the medium we are to understand here, not violent motions ol the
